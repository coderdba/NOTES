Guided conversation:
- User asks a new question
- A tool gets called based on the whole question
- In that tool a workflow (langgraph StateGraph or llamaindex workflow) is defined
- This workflow will have branching, conditional branching, user input etc.
- When user wants to switch to something else, the workflow should send the conversation back to the "user asks a new question" step
- All workflows use the same 'state'
- Workflow modify state, prompt, tools, llm tool binding etc within the workflow
- Each workflow initializes the llm and its tool tool binding as the workflows may not use the same tools
