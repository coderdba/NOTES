User prompt 1 of 3 - 3/11/2025, 8:20:02 PM:
Analyze this list of data for variations and anomalies, average, min, max and periods of sudden fluctuations.

18 23 4 23 23 23 26 22 21 19 20 29 33 35 24 25 21 19 22 22 13 12 8 10 23 24 23 23

Only give the end results and not the intermediate calculations.

GPT-4o mini:
- **Average:** 21.5
- **Minimum:** 4
- **Maximum:** 35
- **Periods of Sudden Fluctuations:** Notable fluctuations occur between 8 and 29, and again between 29 and 4.

User prompt 2 of 3 - 3/11/2025, 8:20:54 PM:
Were here any sudden spikes or drops?

GPT-4o mini:
Yes, there were sudden spikes and drops:

- **Spike:** From 10 to 23 (an increase of 13) and from 29 to 35 (an increase of 6).
- **Drop:** From 35 to 24 (a decrease of 11) and from 24 to 13 (a decrease of 11). 

The most significant drop was from 29 to 4, which is a decrease of 25.

User prompt 3 of 3 - 3/11/2025, 8:21:43 PM:
Were there any gradual but very quick spike or drop

GPT-4o mini:
Yes, there were gradual but quick fluctuations:

- **Quick Spike:** From 19 to 29 (an increase of 10) occurs over a short span of three data points.
- **Quick Drop:** From 29 to 24 (a decrease of 5) occurs immediately after the spike, followed by another drop to 13 (a decrease of 11) shortly after.

These changes happen in a relatively short sequence, indicating rapid fluctuations.
