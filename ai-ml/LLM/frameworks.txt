Agno is a lightweight framework for building AI agents with memory, knowledge, tools, and reasoning. 
It allows developers to create reasoning agents, multimodal agents, teams of agents, and agentic workflows. 

Some of its key features include:
Model Agnostic – Supports multiple model providers without lock-in.
Multi-Agent Architecture – Enables collaboration between AI agents.
Agentic Search – Uses hybrid search with re-ranking for better retrieval.
Long-Term Memory – Provides session storage for agents.
Structured Outputs – Supports JSON-mode responses.
FastAPI Integration – Comes with pre-built routes for serving agents.

Agno also offers a variety of tools that agents can use to interact with external systems, such as web search, database queries, and API calls. Developers can create custom tools using Python functions and integrate them into their agents3.

DIFY
=====================
Dify is an open-source framework designed for building AI workflows, agents, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. 

Key Features of Dify
Agent Node – Allows AI agents to autonomously invoke tools and make decisions within workflows.
Agent Strategies – Supports reasoning methods like ReAct (Reason + Act) and Function Calling.
Workflow Automation – Provides a visual interface for designing AI workflows.
RAG Pipeline – Integrates retrieval-based AI models for enhanced responses.
Model Management – Supports multiple LLM providers and self-hosted solutions

Here's how it compares to frameworks like AutoGen, Braintrust, CrewAI, and Agno:
