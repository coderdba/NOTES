HF_HOME
To configure where huggingface_hub will locally store data. In particular, your token and the cache will be stored in this folder.
- default: Defaults to "~/.cache/huggingface" unless XDG_CACHE_HOME is set.
- Change to: D:\.cache\huggingface

HF_HUB_CACHE
To configure where repositories from the Hub will be cached locally (models, datasets and spaces).

Defaults to "$HF_HOME/hub" (e.g. "~/.cache/huggingface/hub" by default).

HF_ASSETS_CACHE
To configure where assets created by downstream libraries will be cached locally. Those assets can be preprocessed data, files downloaded from GitHub, logs,…

Defaults to "$HF_HOME/assets" (e.g. "~/.cache/huggingface/assets" by default).

HF_TOKEN
To configure the User Access Token to authenticate to the Hub. If set, this value will overwrite the token stored on the machine (in either $HF_TOKEN_PATH or "$HF_HOME/token" if the former is not set).

For more details about authentication, check out this section.

HF_TOKEN_PATH
To configure where huggingface_hub should store the User Access Token. Defaults to "$HF_HOME/token" (e.g. ~/.cache/huggingface/token by default).

HF_HUB_OFFLINE
If set, no HTTP calls will be made to the Hugging Face Hub. If you try to download files, only the cached files will be accessed. If no cache file is detected, an error is raised This is useful in case your network is slow and you don’t care about having the latest version of a file.

If HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 is set as environment variable and you call any method of HfApi, an OfflineModeIsEnabled exception will be raised.

Note: even if the latest version of a file is cached, calling hf_hub_download still triggers a HTTP request to check that a new version is not available. Setting HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 will skip this call which speeds up your loading time.
