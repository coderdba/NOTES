as_query_engine(llm: Optional[LLMType] = None, **kwargs: Any) -> BaseQueryEngine
Convert the index to a query engine.

Calls index.as_retriever(**kwargs) to get the retriever and then wraps it in a RetrieverQueryEngine.from_args(retriever, **kwrags) call.

FROM COPILOT:
In LlamaIndex, as_query_engine and as_retriever serve different purposes and offer distinct functionalities:

as_query_engine:
Purpose: It is used to create a query engine that can handle complex queries and generate responses by synthesizing information from multiple retrieved documents.
Functionality: The query engine not only retrieves relevant documents but also processes and combines the information to provide a coherent response. 
It can use various response modes, such as summarization or detailed explanations.
Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where you need a comprehensive answer that integrates information from multiple sources.

as_retriever:
Purpose: It is used to create a retriever that focuses solely on retrieving the most relevant documents based on the query.
Functionality: The retriever performs similarity searches to find and return the top-k most relevant documents without additional processing or synthesis.
Use Case: Suitable for situations where you need to quickly find and access relevant documents without further processing.
In summary, use as_query_engine when you need detailed, synthesized responses, and use as_retriever when you need to retrieve relevant documents quickly and efficiently12.
