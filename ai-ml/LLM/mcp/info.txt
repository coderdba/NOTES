Yes, MCP (Model Context Protocol) clients can indeed call remotely running MCP servers. This is facilitated through various transport mechanisms, such as HTTP or Server-Sent Events (SSE), allowing clients to interact with servers over the network12.

How It Works
HTTP/SSE Transport: MCP clients can use HTTP or SSE to communicate with remote MCP servers. This enables the client to send requests and receive responses over the internet2.
Adapters: Tools like MCP2HTTP can bridge MCP clients using stdio with stateless HTTP servers, making it easier to connect local clients to remote servers2.
Session Management: Some implementations include session tracking to maintain state across multiple requests, ensuring consistent interactions2.
Example Setup
Server Configuration: Set up your MCP server to listen for HTTP requests.
Client Configuration: Configure your MCP client to send requests to the server's endpoint.
Hereâ€™s a basic example of how you might configure an MCP client to call a remote server:

import requests

def send_request(prompt):
    url = "http://remote-mcp-server.com/mcp"
    payload = {"prompt": prompt}
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key"}
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt = "What is the weather today?"
    result = send_request(prompt)
    print("Response:", result["response"])
This setup allows your MCP client to interact with a remote MCP server, leveraging the flexibility and scalability of network-based communication.
