Key Points:
Replace <your-resource-name>, <your-api-key>, and <your-deployment-name> with your Azure OpenAI resource details.

Ensure the MCP server is running locally or at the specified URL.

Secure your API key and endpoint to prevent unauthorized access.

Let me know if you'd like help setting up the MCP server or configuring Azure OpenAI!
