ROUTING A QUESTION TO A SPECIFIC VECTORSTORE
=================================================

Option 1: Ask if answer is not clear to specify which application or domain. 
Option 2: Display the domains/apps beforehand to choose.  

Once the user chooses or mentions, then store it in the session, run through a matcher and send to the matching vectorstore.

QUESTION:
When working with multiple vectorstores (or multiple indexes) that contain different documents or data domains, you’ll often need to decide which vectorstore is the best match for a given user query. Here are several strategies to direct a user query to the correct vectorstore:

ANSWER:
Classification Before Retrieval

• Use a classifier (such as a TF-IDF classifier, fine-tuned transformer, or any text classification approach) to identify the topic, domain, or intent of the query.

• Based on the predicted category (for example, “legal,” “medical,” or “product manuals”), route the query to the corresponding vectorstore.

• This helps ensure that the search is performed on the most relevant set of documents.
Metadata or Tag Matching

• If your vector entries include metadata (such as tags, domains, or types), parse the user query to detect keywords or entities that match the metadata.

• Use this information as a filter or score factor when deciding which vectorstore to query.

• For example, if the metadata of one vectorstore is labeled as “finance,” and the query includes financial terminology, prefer the “finance” vectorstore.
Hybrid or Ensemble Approaches

• Run the query against multiple vectorstores concurrently and compare the similarity scores from each.

• Choose the store that yields highest-scoring or most confident results—allowing a fallback mechanism if one vectorstore returns no relevant matches.

• This can be done programmatically by executing simultaneous queries and then ranking results based on score thresholds or confidence.
Domain-Specific Routing

• If you’re aware of distinct user groups or document domains, build an initial routing step (for example, using a decision tree or a set of business rules) that directs queries directly into a specific vectorstore.

• This may involve asking the user to provide context or using profile data to pre-select a domain.

• Examples include separate vectorstores for customer support, technical documentation, and product FAQs.
Semantic Similarity as a Proxy

• Embed the user query using the same embedding model used for the vectorstore.

• Compare the query embedding against a “centroid” or representative embedding for each vectorstore.

• Route the query to the vectorstore whose representative embedding is closest in semantic space.

• This approach is particularly useful when domains have clear semantic separation.
Feedback-Loops and Query Rewriting

• Incorporate feedback from users on search result quality.

• Use query rewriting or clarifying questions to better classify the query before running similarity searches.

• An iterative approach might first perform a “broad” search and then further refine which vectorstore is most appropriate, based on initial match quality.
Each of these methods has its own benefits:
 • A pure classification model may work well if you have well-defined domains and enough labeled data.

• Metadata matching is straightforward but may require high-quality, consistent metadata.

• Hybrid approaches (combining semantic similarity and rule-based routing) tend to be robust in changing conditions.

In practice, you might combine multiple strategies to increase robustness. For example, you could first apply metadata filtering, then use a semantic classifier, and finally compare nearest neighbor scores across candidate vectorstores to determine the best match.

By designing your retrieval pipeline around one or several of these strategies, you can improve the likelihood that a given query is directed to the vectorstore most likely to contain relevant results.

Suppose the query is like "I am having access issues" which does not mention for which application it is then which of the above will help?

QUESTION:
If a query like "I am having access issues" doesn’t specify a particular application, strategies that incorporate context identification or fallback mechanisms tend to help the most. Here are a couple of the most relevant approaches in this scenario:

ANSWER:
Classification Before Retrieval

• A classifier can be trained to interpret user queries based on context clues and historical data. Even if the query isn’t explicit about the application, the classifier might have learned that “access issues” often refers to login or permission problems.

• With a well-trained model, you can predict the most likely domain (for example, support ticket for one application versus another) based on the phrasing, even when explicit keywords are missing.
Feedback-Loops and Query Rewriting

• Since the query is ambiguous, an interactive approach might be useful. The system can prompt the user for clarification, such as "Which application or system are you referring to?" or "Are you having issues logging in?"

• This allows the system to collect additional information to then direct the query to the correct vectorstore.

• If immediate clarification isn’t possible (for instance, in an automated logging scenario), you might use initial broad searches from multiple vectorstores and then refine based on result confidence scores.
Hybrid or Ensemble Approaches

• In the absence of clear domain indicators, you could query multiple vectorstores in parallel and let the quality of results (for example, similarity scores or keyword matches within returned documents) guide the selection.

• This way, if one vectorstore (say for application A) returns strong matches compared to others, you can infer that the query most likely relates to that application.
When a user query is vague—like “I am having access issues”—relying solely on metadata matching might fall short if the metadata is sparse or not explicitly mentioned. Instead, applying classification models, leveraging interactive feedback, or using a hybrid approach that considers multiple vectorstores together can pinpoint the user's intended domain more effectively.

These strategies ultimately reduce the misrouting of queries and ensure the search happens in the most relevant context.
