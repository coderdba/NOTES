Create a fastapi python api with two GET endpoints:
- hello which displays just a json message hello world
- health which displays a json that says healthy

Use logger to log every endpoint call with an info message.
Use port 5201


I'll create a FastAPI Python API with the requested endpoints. Let me start by checking if we have a Python environment set up.
Let's create the main FastAPI application file:
Now let's create a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies:
Let's create a README.md file with instructions on how to run the API:
You now have a FastAPI Python API with two GET endpoints:
/hello returns {"message": "hello world"}
/health returns {"status": "healthy"}
The API:
Uses logging to log every endpoint call with an info message
Runs on port 5201
Includes proper request handling and structured logging
To run the API:
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the server: python main.py
Access the endpoints at http://localhost:5201/hello and http://localhost:5201/health
To this program add another endpoint just the root.  When invoked it should send a json which says "Welcome"

I'll add a root endpoint to your FastAPI application that returns a welcome message in JSON format.
Now I'll update the README.md to include the new root endpoint:
I've added the root endpoint (/) to your FastAPI application. It returns a JSON with a "Welcome" message and logs each request just like the other endpoints.
Generate an openapi spec file in yml format and add it to the folder.

I'll create an OpenAPI specification file in YAML format for your FastAPI application.
Now let's update the README to mention the OpenAPI specification file:
I've created an OpenAPI specification file (openapi.yml) that documents your FastAPI application. The specification includes:
API metadata (title, description, version)
Server information (localhost:5201)
Path definitions for all three endpoints (/, /hello, /health)
Response schemas with examples
Component schemas for the response objects
I've also updated the README.md to mention that:
The API is documented using the OpenAPI specification
Users can view the auto-generated Swagger UI documentation at http://localhost:5201/docs
Users can view the ReDoc documentation at http://localhost:5201/redoc
FastAPI automatically generates interactive documentation based on your API implementation, which will match the specification I've provided.
