=====================================
ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION FILE
=====================================
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html

ansible.cfg overrides/sets various variables that control behaviour of ansible during runtime.
This file is set up in the ansible-runner machine.
This file can be used to set ansible_host_key_checking to false etc instead of environment variable export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False

Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be searched for in the following order:
ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)
ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

To create a config file from current setup:
ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg
