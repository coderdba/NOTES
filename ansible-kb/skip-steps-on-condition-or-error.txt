SKIPPING STEPS ON CONDITION OR FALURE OF A STEP
=================================================

COPILOT SOLUTION 1
=========================
Here's a more complete example of an Ansible playbook where we skip tasks and jump to a specific step if a certain task fails. 
We'll use the set_fact module to control the flow based on the result of a failed task:

yaml
- name: Control flow in playbook
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    # Step 1: Successful task
    - name: Step 1 - Initial task
      debug:
        msg: "This is Step 1 - Successful task"

    # Step 2: Task that may fail
    - name: Step 2 - Task that may fail
      command: /bin/false
      register: step_2_result
      failed_when: step_2_result.rc != 0

    # Step 3: Setting a fact based on Step 2's result
    - name: Step 3 - Set control fact if Step 2 fails
      set_fact:
        skip_remaining: true
      when: step_2_result.rc != 0

    # Step 4: Task that will be skipped if Step 2 fails
    - name: Step 4 - Skipped if Step 2 fails
      debug:
        msg: "This is Step 4 - Will only run if Step 2 succeeds"
      when: not skip_remaining | default(false)

    # Step 5: Task to jump to if Step 2 fails
    - name: Step 5 - Task executed regardless of Step 2 result
      debug:
        msg: "This is Step 5 - Always runs after Step 2"
        
How it works:
Step 2 may fail. If it does, the playbook registers this result in the variable step_2_result.

Step 3 sets a control fact (skip_remaining) to true if Step 2 fails.

Step 4 checks the skip_remaining fact. If it's true, this step is skipped.

Step 5 runs regardless of the result of Step 2, allowing you to "jump" to this step.

This structure helps achieve conditional logic in your playbook. Let me know if you'd like further clarifications or enhancements!
