For an ansible user to 'become' root, in /etc/sudoers add these lines (or equivalent):

Here, 'ansible' user's setting works correctly.

## This worked
Cmnd_Alias 	ANSIBLE = /bin/sh
ansible   ALL=ANSIBLE

## This did not work
Cmnd_Alias 	ISITANSIBLE = /bin/su 
sudouser1 ALL=ISITANSIBLE

Test it in unix prompt:
$ sudo su - root -c 'whoami'
root

=================
run.yml
=================
  - name: Playbook
    hosts: localhost
    become: yes
    become_user: root
    tasks:
      - name: create user test1
        user:
          name: test1
          shell: /bin/bash

=================
run.sh
=================
ansible-playbook run.yml --user=ansible --ask-pass --ask-become-pass
