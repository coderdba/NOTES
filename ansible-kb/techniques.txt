CHECK IF FILE CONTAINS A STRING
----------------------------------

-- METHOD1

- name: Check whether /tmp/my.conf contains "127.0.0.1"
  command: grep -Fxq "127.0.0.1" /tmp/my.conf
  register: checkmyconf
  check_mode: no
  ignore_errors: yes
  changed_when: no

- name: Greet the world if /tmp/my.conf contains "127.0.0.1"
  debug: msg="Hello, world!"
  when: checkmyconf.rc == 0

With this solution, even though you ignore errors, you will still get ugly red error output 
on the first task if there is no match:

TASK: [Check whether /tmp/my.conf contains "127.0.0.1"] ***********************
failed: [localhost] => {"changed": false, "cmd": "grep -Fxq "127.0.0.1" /tmp/my.conf", "delta": "0:00:00.018709", 
"end": "2015-09-27 17:46:18.252024", "rc": 1, "start": "2015-09-27 17:46:18.233315", "stdout_lines": [], "warnings": []}
...ignoring

Instead, use:

If you want less verbose output, you can use awk instead of grep.  
awk won't return an error on a non-match, which means the first check task below won't error 
regardless of a match or non-match:

- name: Check whether /tmp/my.conf contains "127.0.0.1"
  command: awk /^127.0.0.1$/ /tmp/my.conf
  register: checkmyconf
  changed_when: False

- name: Greet the world if /tmp/my.conf contains "127.0.0.1"
  debug: msg="Hello, world!"
  when: checkmyconf.stdout | match("127.0.0.1")
  
Notice that this second task uses the match filter as awk returns the matched string if it finds a match.
The alternative above will produce the following output regardless of whether the check task has a match or not:

TASK: [Check whether /tmp/my.conf contains "127.0.0.1"] ***********************
ok: [localhost]
  
- METHOD2

User robo's regexp & absent method is quite clean, so I've fleshed it out here for easy use:

- name: Ensure /tmp/my.conf contains 127.0.0.1
  lineinfile:
    path: /tmp/my.conf
    regexp: '^127\.0\.0\.1.*whatever'
    state: absent
  check_mode: yes
  register: out

- debug:
    msg: "Yes, line exists."
  when: out.changed

- debug:
    msg: "Line does NOT exist."
  when: not out.changed

----------------------------------
ADD A LINE IF IT DOES NOT EXIST
----------------------------------
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30786263/only-check-whether-a-line-present-in-a-file-ansible

Use ansible lineinfile command, but this command will update the file with the line if it does not exists.

- lineinfile: dest=/tmp/my.conf line='127.0.0.1' state=present

- name: "Ensure /tmp/my.conf contains '127.0.0.1'"
  lineinfile:
    name: /tmp/my.conf
    line: "127.0.0.1"
    state: present
  check_mode: yes
  register: conf
  failed_when: (conf is changed) or (conf is failed)

Another way is to use the "replace module" then "lineinfile module".

The algo is closed to the one used when you want to change the values of two variables.

First, use "replace module" to detect if the line you are looking for is here and change it with the something else. 
(Like same line + something at the end).
Then if "replace" is true, It means your line is here then replace the new line with a particularity, 
with the new line looking.

Else the line you are looking for is not here.

Example:

# Vars
- name: Set parameters
  set_fact:
    newline      : "hello, i love ansible"
    lineSearched : "hello"
    lineModified : "hello you"

# Tasks
- name: Try to replace the line
  replace:
    dest    : /dir/file
    replace : '{{ lineModified }} '
    regexp  : '{{ lineSearched }}$'
    backup  : yes
  register  : checkIfLineIsHere

- name: Line is here, change it
  lineinfile:
    state   : present
    dest    : /dir/file
    line    : '{{ newline }}'
    regexp  : '{{ lineModified }}$'
  when: checkIfLineIsHere.changed
  
If the file contains "hello", it will become "hello you" then "hello, i love ansible" at the end.
If the file content doesn't contain "hello", the file is not modified.


With the same idea, you can do something if the lineSearched is here:

# Vars
- name: Set parameters
  set_fact:
    newline      : "hello, i love ansible"
    lineSearched : "hello"
    lineModified : "hello you"

# Tasks
- name: Try to replace the line
  replace:
    dest    : /dir/file
    replace : '{{ lineModified }} '
    regexp  : '{{ lineSearched }}$'
    backup  : yes
  register  : checkIfLineIsHere

# If the line is here, I want to add something.
- name: If line is here, do something
  lineinfile:
    state   : present
    dest    : /dir/file
    line    : '{{ newline }}'
    regexp  : ''
    insertafter: EOF
  when: checkIfLineIsHere.changed

# But I still want this line in the file, Then restore it
- name: Restore the searched line.
  lineinfile:
    state   : present
    dest    : /dir/file
    line    : '{{ lineSearched }}'
    regexp  : '{{ lineModified }}$'
  when: checkIfLineIsHere.changed
  
If the file contains "hello", the line will still contain "hello" and "hello, i love ansible" at the end.
If the file content doesn't contain "hello", the file is not modified.
