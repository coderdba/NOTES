HOST KEY CHECKING
===================================
https://www.ansiblepilot.com/articles/ignore-ansible-ssh-host-key-checking-ansible-configuration/

When ansible-playbook command is run, host-key-checking happens and it needs an interactive answer.
To avoid that interaction in completely touch-free workflows, need to suppress it.

Do it by following ways on the ansible runner machine.

export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
or 
set it in ansible.cfg file (see doc on it in this folder) as follows:
[defaults]
host_key_checking=False
