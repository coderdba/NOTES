This section describes how to install, update, and remove the AWS CLI version 2 on Windows.

Important
AWS CLI versions 1 and 2 use the same aws command name. If you have both versions installed, your computer uses the first one found in your search path. If you previously installed AWS CLI version 1, we recommend that you do one of the following to use AWS CLI version 2:

Recommended – Uninstall AWS CLI version 1 and use only AWS CLI version 2. For uninstall instructions, determine the method you used to install AWS CLI version 1 and follow the appropriate uninstall instructions for your operating system in Installing, updating, and uninstalling the AWS CLI version 1

Use your operating system's ability to create a symbolic link (symlink) or alias with a different name for one of the two aws commands. For example, you can use a symbolic link or alias on Linux and macOS, or DOSKEY on Windows.

For information on breaking changes between version 1 and version 2, see Breaking changes – Migrating from AWS CLI version 1 to version 2.

Prerequisites
Install or update the AWS CLI version 2 on Windows using the MSI installer
Uninstall the AWS CLI version 2 from Windows
Prerequisites
Before you can install or update the AWS CLI version 2 on Windows, be sure you have the following:

A 64-bit version of Windows XP or later.

Admin rights to install software

Install or update the AWS CLI version 2 on Windows using the MSI installer
To update your current installation of AWS CLI version 2 on Windows, download a new installer each time you update to overwrite previous versions. AWS CLI is updated regularly. To see when the latest version was released, see the AWS CLI version 2 changelog on GitHub.

Download and run the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit):

For the latest version of the AWS CLI: https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi

For a specific version of the AWS CLI: Append a hyphen and the version number to the filename. For this example the filename for version 2.0.30 would be AWSCLIV2-2.0.30.msi resulting in the following link https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-2.0.30.msi. For a list of versions, see the AWS CLI version 2 changelog on GitHub.

Alternatively, you can run the msiexec command to run the MSI installer.

C:\> msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
For various parameters that can be used with msiexec, see msiexec on the Microsoft Docs website.

To confirm the installation, open the Start menu, search for cmd to open a command prompt window, and at the command prompt use the aws --version command.

Don't include the prompt symbol (C:\>) when you type a command. These are included in program listings to differentiate commands that you type from output returned by the AWS CLI. The rest of this guide uses the generic prompt symbol ($), except in cases where a command is Windows-specific. For more information about how we format code examples, see Using the AWS CLI examples.

C:\> aws --version
aws-cli/2.1.29 Python/3.7.4 Windows/10 botocore/2.0.0

Actual version gotten:
aws --version
aws-cli/2.0.30 Python/3.7.7 Windows/10 botocore/2.0.0dev34

If Windows is unable to find the program, you might need to close and reopen the command prompt window to refresh the path, or add the installation directory to your PATH environment variable manually.
