Configure GTM cloud-based services
https://techdocs.akamai.com/gtm/docs/config-gtm-cloud-services
  GTM was designed to load balance between data centers with static IP addresses, not between VM environments 
  or cloud-based services that need to be load balanced between changing IP addresses. 
  You might need to use GTM to balance load between two or more servers in the cloud. 
  In this case, the provider supplies a hostname for each cloud region 
  that resolves to one or more virtual machines in a the region.
