A service to register, secure and manage API access.
Like API Keys, certs etc

- Create an API Management instance: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/get-started-create-service-instance

- 'Subscriptions' - which are API Keys: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-subscriptions
	- also, see 'product'
	- a subscription is for a product - and a product is a group of api's

Tutorial series
- import and publish an API: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/import-and-publish
- product: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-add-products?tabs=azure-portal
	In Azure API Management, a product contains one or more APIs, a usage quota, and the terms of use. 
	After a product is published, developers can subscribe to the product and begin to use the product's APIs.

REVIEW AND CREATE

Creation happens immediately
However, it will be in 'activating' state - which can take some time to create

=========================
CREATE A PRODUCT - so that APIs can be grouped under this, and a "subscription' like an api-key can be provided
=========================
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-add-products?tabs=azure-portal

In Azure portal
- go to the api-management instance created earlier
- choose 'products' in the left hand side blade menu

You will see the message and already published two intial products:
Products let you group APIs, define terms of use, and runtime policies. 
API consumers can subscribe to a product on the developer portal to obtain a key to call your APIs. Learn more

Display name	Access control					State
Starter		Administrators, Developers, Guests		Published
Unlimited	Administrators, Developers, Guests		Published

--> Click on these and you can see under "Protection" that they require subscription (api key equivalent)

------------------
ADD A NEW PRODUCT
------------------
Click "Add Product"
Enter details:
- Display name: My1
- Id: my1 (auto populated - can be modified)
- Description: My product 1
- Check these boxes:
	Published
	Requires Subscription
	Keep unchecked - Requires Approval

------------------
ADD A SUBSCRIPTION - api key equivalent
------------------
Go to 'Subscriptions' blade of API management instance
You can see some subscriptions already there
- Two unnamed - attached to the two initial products "Starter" and "Unlimited"
- Another unnamed automatically created subscription for the newly created product 'My1'
- An internal subscription "Built in All Access Subscription"

Assign names for the unnamed ones as below:
- Default-For-Product-Starter
- Default-For-Product-Unlimited
- Default-For-Product-My1

--> However, their primary and secondary keys were displayed as dots --> copy them and paste elsewhere to see the real keys


Add a new subscription
- Name: Product-My1-Subscription1
- Display Name: Product-My1-Subscription1
- Scope: Product
- Product: My1
- User: Administrator (shows my email)
- Send notification for: For developer portal

--> Upon creation, primary and secondary keys were displayed as dots --> copy them and paste elsewhere to see the real keys
--> AZURE SENT AN EMAIL TO ADMINISTRATOR (myself) confirming creation
