APP REGISTRATION
======================================

App registration denotes an authorized app in Azure (it can be associated with one or more actual apps)
This can be used for many thing - SSO, KV access etc
When used for SSO, in React, the following setting uses the ID of the app-registration entity:
    authority: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/05d75c05-fa1a-42e7-9cf1-lkjsdlfksjlfsj',
    clientId: '564c69ff-2965-41fb-b2e3-lksdjflksjfslk', --> THIS IS THE APP REGISTRATION
Essentially - it acts as an authorized key for applications to access things associated to the app-registration
Like redirect URLs, just as plain "yes this is an azure app in the given subscription" (tenant), SSO, KV access etc

==============
NOTES
==============
App Registration --> to register, set secrets, certs, redirect urls etc
Enterprise Applications --> view the registered application and administer a few things
Users --> actual users like myself, my ADM account etc

Enable "ID Token" authentication: To fix - AADSTS700054: response_type 'id_token' is not enabled for the application. - To resolve this error you need to navigate to Azure Portal > Azure AD > App Registrations > select All Applications tab > Search with the Client ID you used > Open the application and go to Authentication blade > Under Implicit Grant section, select checkbox for ID Token.
