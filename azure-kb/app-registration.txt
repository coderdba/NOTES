App registration denotes an authorized app in Azure (it can be associated with one or more actual apps)
This can be used for many thing - SSO, KV access etc
When used for SSO, in React, the following setting uses the ID of the app-registration entity:
    authority: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/05d75c05-fa1a-42e7-9cf1-lkjsdlfksjlfsj',
    clientId: '564c69ff-2965-41fb-b2e3-lksdjflksjfslk', --> THIS IS THE APP REGISTRATION
Essentially - it acts as an authorized key for applications to access things associated to the app-registration
Like redirect URLs, just as plain "yes this is an azure app in the given subscription" (tenant), SSO, KV access etc
