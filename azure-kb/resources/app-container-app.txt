One or more images
Multiple images get deployed as 'pod' (similar to kubernetes)
Set environment variables per image (which will be used by container of that image)
To modify environment variable - choose 'containers' menu --> Edit and Deploy --> Container Image --> Add --> then add the image and environment variables --> Save
--> then it will prompt for redeploy
