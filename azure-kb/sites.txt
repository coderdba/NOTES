IMAGE BUILDING - AZURE SUPPORTS AMD, BUT MACS ARE M1/ARM NOWADAYS
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73621200/how-to-host-a-arm64-docker-container-on-azure-container-apps

    Currently, Azure Container Apps only support Linux-based x86-64 (linux/amd64) container images so you can't deploy an ARM-based container. Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/containers

    On a M1 Mac, you can build multiarch containers using Buildx. This way, you can build an x86-64 version of your container that you'll be able to deploy on Container Apps. Documentation: https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#build-multi-arch-images-with-buildx
    
    You can also build the container image using your Azure Container Registry, instead of building it locally using cross-compile. ACR can build it for amd64. Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/acr?view=azure-cli-latest#az-acr-build

on-premises data gateway
==========================================
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/gateway-reference

The on-premises data gateway acts as a bridge to provide quick and secure data transfer between on-premises data (data that isn't in the cloud) and several Microsoft cloud services. These cloud services include Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate, Azure Analysis Services, and Azure Logic Apps. By using a gateway, organizations can keep databases and other data sources on their on-premises networks, yet securely use that on-premises data in cloud services.
