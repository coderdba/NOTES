API-UI REPEATABLE CODE

Let us keep it simple, quick and repeatable.

 By that what I mean is - if we have a table get, post, put, delete - we should not spend too much time developing the whole thing.  

What code should go into the API
What code should go into the UI for 'a table'
What code should go into a dropdown (for master-child tables)

Done.

 Then next table comes, we just copy-paste and it should be done.

In the API code:

Standardize:
Make one file per table with all controllers - to contain all kinds of gets, puts, posts, deletes. 

Standardize it with ALL error checks, http codes (appropriate codes of 200, 300, 400, 500 series - not random)
One contoller file for all tables
Any other standardization

^^ Similarly in UI code also.

This is what I think.  Give a thought, and let us make one API code right today itself and review
I mean, API code for one table
