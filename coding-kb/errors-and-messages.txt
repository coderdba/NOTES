Check all possibilities of errors - guidance is there from the work done so far
Use 0 or 1 error code from functions
Provide appropriate log-messages
Provide same or clear message to return to the user in http response
Use appropriate http response codes  (I guess we used 422 and such in some APIs which is not appropriate)

INFO, ERR, CRIT, WARN, DEBUG - tags to use with messages
