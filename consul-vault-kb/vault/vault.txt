INSTALL
===============

- First create a consul (see other doc TBD)

- Install vault - download and zip 'vault' into /usr/local/bin

Configure: /etc/vault.d/config.hcl
NOTE: Consul section is for the consul you have created
NOTE: The addresses for the listener is given as 0.0.0.0 --> it may be security risk

storage "consul" {
  address = "110.192.217.4:8500"
  path    = "vault/"
  scheme  = "http"
}

listener "tcp" {
 address          = "0.0.0.0:8200"
 cluster_address  = "0.0.0.0:8201"
 tls_disable = "true"
  scheme  = "http"
}

--- OLD CONFIG FILE
storage "consul" {
  address = "101.192.217.4:8500"
  path    = "vault/"
  scheme  = "http"
}

listener "tcp" {
 address     = "127.0.0.1:8200"
 # using actual IP is giving problem while accessing or unsealing vault
 #address     = "10.92.217.4:8200"
 tls_disable = 1
  scheme  = "http"
}

- Start Vault
NOTE: Run it in 'nohup' or create a systemd service

NOTE: Need to set environment variable to point to http address - to use http instead of https
      Otherwise, the vault client will he https and consul MAY BE http and if so, then you get the following error
      Error unsealing: Put https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/unseal: http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client
        https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/1147
        
# export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
# vault server -config=/etc/vault.d/config.hcl 

Now, you can see vault in consul

- Initialize
# vault operator init
Unseal Key 1: axNHQL7sdfsdfskkaGbUJ7BLLBE9KuigR+zx+flsdfpuEVhIaZJ/POy
Unseal Key 2: nJXwnD0ffQ8UQEkESVYsdfsdfmAQnv1LRDLSOq0+n1y+K+Md+Vh
Unseal Key 3: pzBvR0Leny5d+dzGqsdfsdyTW97xVyuYCcMonLfXsdfdsryjVQy2kq
Unseal Key 4: znTqCsFkAcv+jyysdfsdf+eRAdJY3V8EbLvOHwtr/c+I5t7wf//
Unseal Key 5: UUygBAtZX6dmfYCysdfsdfpR/1lPkt+lhNXMROoRE3QE0JPaEk7

Initial Root Token: 26TIbLMsdfs5CCRMX7XQ6UqxcfyhY

Also, note down the token in the file /root/.vault-token
6cL8ns3msdfsd9dSRIVXJFx0lhF8q

- Unseal the vault (must be done upon vault or server restart)
NOTE: Do this 'unseal' three times (minimum) and give a different unseal key each time

# vault operator unseal

Now you can see vault in unsealed state in consul

=================
HA CLUSTER
=================
HA cluster is formed by registering more nodes with the SAME CONSUL.

On more nodes:
Repeat the steps of install/config - EXCEPT INITIALIZE
DO NOT RUN 'vault operator init'

=================
ACCESS VAULT
=================
Just access consul on webui - and look for vault in it
