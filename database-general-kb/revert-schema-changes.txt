Reverting from schema changes
Snapshot - Database Snapshots (SQL Server) - SQL Server | Microsoft Learn
Option 1:  Reconstruct only required tables/indexes querying their structure and data from the snapshot
This is more advantageous than option2 as we wont lose whole databases' changes when we revert
Also, we can rename the current table (which underwent schema change), reconstruct the table and data using snapshot, and also try recover some or all changes to data from the renamed table
Option 2:  Revert the whole DB to the state of the snapshot taken earlier
Schema changes and data-add/modify/delete done after snapshot was created will be lost
Point in time recovery - using the full, incremental and log backups
This is recovering using backups regularly taken
Does not need taking snapshot (snapshot needs time to create and uses disk space)
Exact time and disk space needs to be experimented
Disadvantages:
It takes much time to restore and the whole database reverts to a point in time
Another option:
Backup (I guess export) just the affected tables with data before schema changes, with apps accessing that table stopped
To revert, use techniques like those in option1 mentioned above
Debug log for stored procedures:
If the users have read-access to stored procedure code (in addition to execute privilege), they can use SSMS to debug: Debugging stored procedures in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
Other than this, I am not aware where we can turn a "debug mode" on 
Alternative:  Create a sort of 'turn on debug'
Add many "print" statements in the stored proc code
Create a table stored_proc_debug_mode with stored proc name and debug flag
Set that debug flag as needed
Make whichever is 'debug' type to print based on an if then else condition based on that setting
View the logs with normal and debug 'prints' 
I hope this helps!
