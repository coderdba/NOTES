db2pd

Using db2pd
- 2 commands that show which ones are using high cpu
- To pose artificial load - do a cartesian join - select count(*) from syscat.tables, syscat.tables, syscat.tables
- Top command now shows command "db2sysc" is taking high cpu
- The 2 commands:
-- db2pd -edus
-- db2pd -db SAMPLE -applications

db2pd -edus
EDU ID, TID, Kernel ID, EDU Name, USR(s), SYS(s)
The EDU Name will be like - db2agntdp, db2agent, db2pfchr, db2wlmd ...

db2pd -db SAMPLE -applications
This shows CoorEDUID - and AppHandl
Get the AppHandl for the CoorEDUID obtained for high consumer in the step "db2pd -edus"

db2 list applications
Will give Appl Handl, Application Id, Application Name etc
Then run "db2 get snapshot for application agentid <give the agent id>"
- the agent id is the AppHandl gotten earlier
That will give much more detailed info on which server the app is coming from, various statistics etc
