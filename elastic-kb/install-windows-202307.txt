Γä╣∩╕Å  Configure other nodes to join this cluster:
ΓÇó On this node:
  Γüâ Create an enrollment token with `bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node`.
  Γüâ Uncomment the transport.host setting at the end of config/elasticsearch.yml.
  Γüâ Restart Elasticsearch.
ΓÇó On other nodes:
  Γüâ Start Elasticsearch with `bin/elasticsearch --enrollment-token <token>`, using the enrollment token that you generated.

===========================================
SECURITY SETUP - CERTS, PASSWORDS, TOKENS
===========================================
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/configuring-stack-security.html
When you start Elasticsearch for the first time, the following security configuration occurs automatically:

Certificates and keys for TLS are generated for the transport and HTTP layers.
The TLS configuration settings are written to elasticsearch.yml.
A password is generated for the elastic user.
An enrollment token is generated for Kibana.

You can then start Kibana and enter the enrollment token, which is valid for 30 minutes. This token automatically applies the security settings from your Elasticsearch cluster, authenticates to Elasticsearch with the built-in kibana service account, and writes the security configuration to kibana.yml.

From the installation directory, start Elasticsearch. A password is generated for the elastic user and output to the terminal, plus an enrollment token for enrolling Kibana.

bin/elasticsearch

Copy the generated password and enrollment token and save them in a secure location. These values are shown only when you start Elasticsearch for the first time.

If you need to reset the password for the elastic user or other built-in users, run the elasticsearch-reset-password tool. To generate new enrollment tokens for Kibana or Elasticsearch nodes, run the elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token tool. These tools are available in the Elasticsearch bin directory.

(Optional) Open a new terminal and verify that you can connect to your Elasticsearch cluster by making an authenticated call. Enter the password for the elastic user when prompted:

curl --cacert config/certs/http_ca.crt -u elastic https://localhost:9200
curl --cacert D:\opt\elasticsearch-8.8.2\config\certs\http_ca.crt -u elastic https://localhost:9200
C:\Users\ADMIN>curl --cacert D:\opt\elasticsearch-8.8.2\config\certs\http_ca.crt -u elastic https://localhost:9200
Enter host password for user 'elastic':
curl: (77) schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed: SEC_E_UNTRUSTED_ROOT (0x80090325) - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.

C:\Users\ADMIN>curl --insecure --cacert D:\opt\elasticsearch-8.8.2\config\certs\http_ca.crt -u elastic https://localhost:9200
Enter host password for user 'elastic':
{"error":{"root_cause":[{"type":"security_exception","reason":"unable to authenticate user [elastic] for REST request [/]","header":{"WWW-Authenticate":["Basic realm=\"security\" charset=\"UTF-8\"","Bearer realm=\"security\"","ApiKey"]}}],"type":"security_exception","reason":"unable to authenticate user [elastic] for REST request [/]","header":{"WWW-Authenticate":["Basic realm=\"security\" charset=\"UTF-8\"","Bearer realm=\"security\"","ApiKey"]}},"status":401}

From the directory where you installed Kibana, start Kibana.

bin/kibana


Enroll Kibana using either interactive or detached mode.

Interactive mode (browser)

In your terminal, click the generated link to open Kibana in your browser.
In your browser, paste the enrollment token that you copied and click the button to connect your Kibana instance with Elasticsearch.

Kibana won’t enter interactive mode if it detects existing credentials for Elasticsearch (elasticsearch.username and elasticsearch.password) or an existing URL for elasticsearch.hosts.

Detached mode (non-browser)

Run the kibana-setup tool and pass the generated enrollment token with the --enrollment-token parameter.

bin/kibana-setup --enrollment-token <enrollment-token>

- NOTES
Initially created certificates are kept her: D:\opt\elasticsearch-8.8.2\config\certs
