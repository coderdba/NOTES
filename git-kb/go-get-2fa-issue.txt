PROBLEM:
Golang uses http and not ssh when doing "go get repo"
When git is configured with 2FA the go get gives error invalid user/pass
To overcome that, we can use personal access token --> generate in your git under 'settings' of your user

Create a file ~/.netrc with the following content:

machine github.com
    login <github username>
    password <github password or Personal access tokens >
    
machine git.company.com
    login <git company com username>
    password <github password or Personal access tokens >

machine github.com
    login myusername
    password 92dsff9csdflksjf99bd365e5ok09a275d
    
Maybe you need to set GOPRIVATE:
export GOPRIVATE=git.company.com/*
OR
export GOPRIVATE=git.company.com/org/repo

Then do go get git.company.com/cloudOrg/myrepo
