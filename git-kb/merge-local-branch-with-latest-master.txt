Create a branch locally:
git clone <rep url>
cd repo-dir
git checkout -b abc
do your changes

Push branch to from local to git:
git add .
git commit -m "some message"
git push -u origin abc
Then in github web do a pull request and then merge

To merge local branch with remote latest master code:
This may not be accurate: (see better code further below)
    git branch master
    git pull origin master
    git branch pqr
    git merge master --> to merge latest 'master' with branch pqr


git merge origin/master into branch:
git checkout dmgr2      # gets you "on branch dmgr2"
git fetch origin        # gets you up to date with origin
git merge origin/master

git merge branch to master:
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git merge iss53
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.

git merge master into branch: (NOTE: actually, here, master gets code from branch merged into master)
# merge feature branch to origin/master branch
$ git checkout master
$ git pull origin/master
$ git merge feature
$ git push origin/master

merge master into local branch:
git checkout feature1
git merge master --> before that, get the latest master if local master is old: git checkout master; git pull origin/master)

merge branch to master:
First we have to come in the branch
which we want to merge the codes in. 
It means generally we should come
into master branch in this case.
- git checkout master ==>
                now you are in master branch
- git pull origin master ==> 
              We are pulling recent code from master branch 
                                                    on GitHub
- git merge develop -m "your message here" ==> 
            to merge a develop branch into master branch 
- git add . 
- git commit -m "final commit"
- git push origin master
- now when other team members pull master
they will see what you sent
*** git rebase LoginFeatureBranch ==>
                This will merge Login with Master but 
closes the LoginFeatureBranch for good (completely).

merge master into branch:
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout test
git merge master
git push
