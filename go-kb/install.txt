INSTALL MY NOTES
====================
- https://golang.org/doc/install

NOTE: These steps - tar or package method - will install into /usr/local/go folder with 'bin' in it.

I installed multiple versions this way:
12.9 - first untar or install using package - it installs into /usr/local/go - rename it to /usr/local/go/go.12.9
13.9 - first untar or install using package - it installs into /usr/local/go - rename it to /usr/local/go/go.13.9
- That is, rename the folder 'go' to go.12.9 or go.13.9 and move it to under /usr/local/go

Then, use whichever version

- TARBALL
Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD tarballs
Download the archive and extract it into /usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go. For example:

tar -C /usr/local -xzf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
Choose the archive file appropriate for your installation. For instance, if you are installing Go version 1.2.1 for 64-bit x86 on Linux, the archive you want is called go1.2.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz.

(Typically these commands must be run as root or through sudo.)

Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
Note: changes made to a profile file may not apply until the next time you log into your computer. To apply the changes immediately, just run the shell commands directly or execute them from the profile using a command such as source $HOME/.profile.

- MACOS PACKAGE INSTALLER
macOS package installer
Download the package file, open it, and follow the prompts to install the Go tools. The package installs the Go distribution to /usr/local/go.

The package should put the /usr/local/go/bin directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.
