GOROUTINES
===========
2k mem, grows as needed (vs 1mb per thread in os threads)
Go does its own connection pooling - so, if there are many threads from programs, go sends them to OS only as needed

- SYNC PACKAGE
golang.org/pkg/sync
Main functions in sync package:
- WaitGroup
- Mutex
- RWMutex

Waitgroups - to make a goroutine wait on other goroutines
- Like a supervisor goroutine - waits for a collection of goroutines to finish
- normally, those goroutines are created by waitgroup itself
- waits for those children to complete and then continues its own execution

Mutexes - to manage shared memory
- 'mut'ual 'ex'clusion lock
- to protect a piece of code so that only the holder of the mutex lock only can access it 
- so that only one task access that code at any point in time
- In the example of db and cache queries - db is persistent - and for every DB query cache is updated
  - in the querydb function, querydb and querycache - if run as goroutines, both groutines will be accessing same memory
  - that will cause conflicts
  - mutexes help here
  
querycache(id)
{
value=getValFromCache --> place mutex before and after this line
return value
}
querydb(id)
{
value=getValFromDB
setcache(id)=value --> place mutex before and after this line
return value
}

- during runtime we get 'race' condition related errors (like waiting for lock)
- To get warning on race conditions during runtime:
go run --race .
or go build --race

- with sleep line in code, it may appear to work well, but race condition may have been circumvented

RW-MUTEX
- in the above example, mutexes can be placed as noted. 
- however, it is not worthwhile to have a mutex for read when majority are reads and very small amount of writes 
- and mutexes are needed only when a read happens while a write is happening
- RW Mutex (RLock and RUnlock) - will not hold locks for just reads - they lock and unlock only when a write also is active
- They are MORE EXPENSIVE than regular mutex

=======================
CHANNELS
=======================
Mutexes - goroutines share memory and lock/unlock the memory as needed
Channels - enable goroutines send copies of memory between them 

Buffered & unbuffered
Send only, receive only, send and receive - various ways they can operaete
Open and close channels

Channels need goroutines - because unless a listener is there, a channel cannot receive anything
- Say, there are two functions - one for putting stuff into a channel and the other to receive from the channel and print
  - Even if those functions are called in any order - as goroutines - with waitgroups - then channel can write and read
- Else, if we just have fmt.Println (<-ch) and ch <- 42 
  - if print comes first then it cannot print (receive message) as channel is not populated yet (message not yet available)
  - if population step comes first then it cannot populate because there is no listener/consumer to the channel 
  - therefore, if we have those statements in goroutines and run them simultaneously the waitgroup will ensure both run
