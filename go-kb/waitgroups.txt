func (*WaitGroup) Add
func (wg *WaitGroup) Add(delta int)
Add adds delta, which may be negative, to the WaitGroup counter. 
If the counter becomes zero, all goroutines blocked on Wait are released. 
If the counter goes negative, Add panics.

Note that calls with a positive delta that occur when the counter is zero must happen before a Wait. 
Calls with a negative delta, or calls with a positive delta 
that start when the counter is greater than zero, may happen at any time. 
Typically this means the calls to Add should execute before the statement creating the goroutine or other event to be waited for. If a WaitGroup is reused to wait for several independent sets of events, new Add calls must happen after all previous Wait calls have returned. See the WaitGroup example.
