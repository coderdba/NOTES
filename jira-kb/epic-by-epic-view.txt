PROBLEM
TO SHOW EPIC-WISE TASKS RATHER THAN JUST A LIST OF RANDOM TASKS
- Epics show one below the other - each with a dropdown button
- Columns TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE
- Epics when clicked show the stories under them

SOLUTION
Set up "swimlanes" for your epics on your board
During a sprint, you might find it useful to divide your board into swimlanes for each epic, to make the board visually clearer.

Here's how you can set this up in Jira Software:
- Navigate to the Backlog (or active sprint).
- Select more (three dot button) > Board settings.
- Click on Swimlanes.
- Under Base swimlanes on, select Epics.
- When you start a sprint, your board will show issues grouped under their respective epics.
