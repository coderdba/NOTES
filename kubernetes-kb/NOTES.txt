BOOT SEQUENCE
==============
ETCD - from /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service
API Server, Controller Manager, Scheduler - by kubelet service in /usr/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service and kubelet.service.d

https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/boot-sequence/
On masters:
kube-apiserver
kube-controller-manager (which runs miscellaneous controllers)
kube-scheduler (which assigns pods to nodes)

Also:
etcd --> If it is created as a pod (not in my case where I start etcd by its service)
dns-controller (like coredns) --> this was created afterwards as a pod - so apiserver/etcd know about it already

On nodes:
kube-proxy (which configures iptables so that the k8s-network will work)
