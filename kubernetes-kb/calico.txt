=======================================
Quickstart for Calico on Kubernetes
=======================================
https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.4/getting-started/kubernetes/

Overview
This quickstart gets you a single-host Kubernetes cluster with Calico in approximately 15 minutes. You can use this cluster for testing and development.

To deploy a cluster suitable for production, refer to Installation.

Requirements
AMD64 processor
2CPU
2GB RAM
10GB free disk space
RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.x+, CentOS 7.x+, Ubuntu 16.04+, or Debian 9.x+
Before you begin
Ensure that Calico can manage cali and tunl interfaces on the host. If NetworkManager is present on the host, refer to Configure NetworkManager.

Follow the Kubernetes instructions to install kubeadm.

Note: After installing kubeadm, do not power down or restart the host. Instead, continue directly to the next section to create your cluster.

Create a single-host Kubernetes cluster
As a regular user with sudo privileges, open a terminal on the host that you installed kubeadm on.

Initialize the master using the following command.

sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16
Note: If 192.168.0.0/16 is already in use within your network you must select a different pod network CIDR, replacing 192.168.0.0/16 in the above command as well as in any manifests applied below.

Execute the following commands to configure kubectl (also returned by kubeadm init).

mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Install an etcd instance with the following command.

kubectl apply -f \
https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.4/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/etcd.yaml
Note: You can also view the YAML in a new tab.

You should see the following output.

daemonset.extensions/calico-etcd created
service/calico-etcd created

Install Calico with the following command.

kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.4/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/hosted/calico.yaml
Note: You can also view the YAML in a new tab.

You should see the following output.

configmap/calico-config created
secret/calico-etcd-secrets created
daemonset.extensions/calico-node created
serviceaccount/calico-node created
deployment.extensions/calico-kube-controllers created
serviceaccount/calico-kube-controllers created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/calico-kube-controllers created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/calico-kube-controllers created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/calico-node created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/calico-node created
Confirm that all of the pods are running with the following command.

watch kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

Wait until each pod has the STATUS of Running.

NAMESPACE    NAME                                       READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE

kube-system  kube-scheduler-jbaker-1                    1/1    Running  0         5m41s
Press CTRL+C to exit watch.

Remove the taints on the master so that you can schedule pods on it.

kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-
It should return the following.

node/<your-hostname> untainted
Confirm that you now have a node in your cluster with the following command.

kubectl get nodes -o wide
It should return something like the following.

NAME              STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION    CONTAINER-RUNTIME

Congratulations! You now have a single-host Kubernetes cluster equipped with Calico.
