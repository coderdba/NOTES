Kub doc on ingress: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/

NGINX BASED
This one looks like official one: 
(directed from k8 doc https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/ 
- in the sentence "Kubernetes as a project currently supports and maintains GCE and nginx controllers")
https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/README.md
https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/master/docs/deploy/index.md

- Uses image: quay.io/kubernetes-ingress-controller/nginx-ingress-controller:0.21.0
- Its development page: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/development/

FURTHER, NGINX BASED:
USING NGINX AS INGRESS CONTROLLER
