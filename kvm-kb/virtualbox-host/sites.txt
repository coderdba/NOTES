Bridged Networking:
==============================
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
USE THIS: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-use-bridged-networking-with-libvirt-and-kvm --> ip link commands 
--> with "virsh net-define"
--> netfilter etc
- Use this primarily - with network-scripts: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-use-bridged-networking-with-libvirt-and-kvm#h5-disabling-netfilter-for-the-bridge
--> This has virsh net-define also which is missing in most other docs
