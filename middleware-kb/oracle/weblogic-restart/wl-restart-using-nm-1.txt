Script to start Weblogic servers and Managed servers

Can someone help me to write script to perform below steps in weblogic.

1.Stop Managed Servers 2.Stop Node Manager 3.Stop Admin Server 4.Delete the tmp,cache folders.

The steps you mentioned can be done with WLST and Node Manager. However, you need to make the following adjustments:

Configure Node Manager/WebLogic Domain to stop using the demo SSL certificate when accessing/starting Node Manager.

Configure Node Manager

Edit nodemanager.properties and set the following:
SecureListener to false
QuitEnabled to true
Restart Node Manager
Configure WebLogic Domain

Login to WebLogic Domain
Under Environment, Machines: click the Machine name configured
Under Configuration, Node Manager: set Type to Plain and save
Restart WebLogic Domain (Admin Server + Managed Servers)
Configure WebLogic Domain's Node Manager Credentials. The default is usually the username/password you entered when creating the WebLogic Domain. However, it is also a good idea to set different credentials for the Node Manager. This is totally optional, especially when working in a development environment.

Login to WebLogic Domain
Under Domain Structure, click the Weblogic Domain name
Under Security, General: click Advanced
Set the NodeManager Username and NodeManager Password/Confirm NodeManager Password and click Save
For this answer, I will use nodemanager/nodemanager_pwd as sample values.
Assuming you have one Admin Server and one Managed Server, both on the same machine, write the following commands in a Python script:

# Connect to the Node Manager running on localhost with port 5556.
# Change the DOMAIN_NAME and the DOMAIN_HOME as appropriate
nmConnect('nodemanager','nodemanager_pwd','localhost','5556','DOMAIN_NAME','DOMAIN_HOME','PLAIN')

# Start the Admin Server. 
# The following command assumes that the 
# name of the Admin Server is AdminServer
nmServerStart('AdminServer')

# Start the Managed Server. Again, change the Managed Server name as appropriate
nmServerStart('Managed_Server_01')
To stop the Managed Server and Admin Server, it's the opposite direction with the sequence, and now you need to use the nmKill command. The stopNodeManager() is possible if the QuitEnabled property was set to true in the nodemanager.properties file.

nmConnect('nodemanager','nodemanager_pwd','localhost','5556','DOMAIN_NAME','DOMAIN_HOME','PLAIN')
nmKill('Managed_Server_01')
nmKill('AdminServer')
stopNodeManager()
When invoking the Python script that contains the commands above, execute the following command:

$MW_HOME/oracle_common/common/bin/wlst.sh startup.py
$MW_HOME/oracle_common/common/bin/wlst.sh shutdown.py
As for the clearing of the tmp/cache folders, these can all be done via shell script (assuming you're running on Linux)

The above is if SecureListener is set to false. If you mean to say that your SecureListener was set to true, then just use SSL instead of Plain. That applies on nmConnect() and on Machine configuration. Then again, if you're just using the demo WebLogic SSL certificate instead of your own, it might be better to use Plain instead of SSL. –
