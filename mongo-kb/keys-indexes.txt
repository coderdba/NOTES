----------------------------------------------------
Method1: Create a "Manual Reference" in the Terminal
----------------------------------------------------
Consider the following operation to insert two documents, 
using the _id field of the first document as a reference in the second document:

original_id = ObjectId()
db.places.insertOne({
    "_id": original_id,
    "name": "Broadway Center",
    "url": "bc.example.net"
})
db.people.insertOne({
    "name": "Erin",
    "places_id": original_id,
    "url":  "bc.example.net/Erin"
})

TWO Queries are needed - CANNOT JOIN TWO COLLECTIONS (unlike RDBMS)
Then, when a query returns the document from the people collection you can, 
if needed, make a second query for the document referenced by the places_id field in the places collection.

Therefore, APPLICATION has to figure out parents/children etc using such second or additional queries.

IMPORTANT: The only limitation of manual linking is that these references do not convey the database and collection names. 

If you have documents in a single collection that relate to documents in more than one collection, 
you may need to consider using DBRefs.

----------------------------------------------------
Method2: DBRefs
----------------------------------------------------
Documents in one collection relate to documents in more than one collection, then create DBRefs.

Background
DBRefs are a convention for representing a document, rather than a specific reference type. 
They include the name of the collection, and in some cases the database name, in addition to the value from the _id field.

Optionally, DBRefs can include any number of other fields. 
Extra field names must follow any rules for field names imposed by the server version.

Format
DBRefs have the following fields:

$ref
The $ref field holds the name of the collection where the referenced document resides.

$id
The $id field contains the value of the _id field in the referenced document.

$db
Optional.

Contains the name of the database where the referenced document resides.

EXAMPLE
DBRef documents resemble the following document:

{ "$ref" : <value>, "$id" : <value>, "$db" : <value> }

Consider a document from a collection that stored a DBRef in a creator field:

{
  "_id" : ObjectId("5126bbf64aed4daf9e2ab771"),
  // .. application fields
  "creator" : {
                  "$ref" : "creators",  --> Name of the reference collection
                  "$id" : ObjectId("5126bc054aed4daf9e2ab772"), --> ID Field in the reference collection
                  "$db" : "users", --> Database of the reference collection
                  "extraField" : "anything" --> any arbitrary thing, not related to references
               }
}

The DBRef in this example points to a document in the creators collection of the users database 
that has ObjectId("5126bc054aed4daf9e2ab772") in its _id field. It also contains an optional field.
