F5Load Balancer - https intake, http with web servers behind it
https://www.lullabot.com/articles/setting-up-ssl-offloading-termination-on-an-f5-bigip-load-balancer
    One of the primary reasons for investing in an F5 is for the purpose of SSL Offloading, that is, 
    converting external HTTPS traffic into normal HTTP traffic so that your web servers don't need to do the work themselves.
    HTTPS requests (and more specifically, the SSL handshaking to start the connection) is incredibly expensive, 
    often on the magnitude of at least 10 times slower than normal HTTP requests.
