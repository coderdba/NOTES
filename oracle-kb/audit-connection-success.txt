Oracle:  Tracking failed logon attempts
Oracle Database Tips by Donald BurlesonJune 9, 2015


Question:  I'm doing an audit and I need to be able to track all failed login (logon) attempts.  Because the user never gets logged-on to Oracle, how can you track failed sign on attempts to Oracle?

Answer:  Yes, it is difficult to audit failed sign-on attempts because the user never gets connected to Oracle, and a logon trigger would not be useful because it requires a valid login, not just an attempt.  For complete directions on auditing Oracle failed sign-on attempts, see my book "Oracle Privacy Security Auditing".

The Oracle auditing utility has this command:

audit create session whenever not successful;

To enable auditing of failed sign-on attempts:

1 - Add initialization parameters & bounce instance:

audit_trail=true

audit_file_dest='/u01/app/oracle/mysid/mydir/'

2 - Enable auditing of failed logion attempts as SYSDBA:

SQL> audit create session whenever not successful;

3 - You can now view failed login attempts in dba_audit_trail:

select
   os_username,
   username,
   terminal,
   to_char(timestamp,'MM-DD-YYYY HH24:MI:SS')
from
   dba_audit_trail;

OS_USERNAME     USERNAME        TERMINAL        TO_CHAR(TIMESTAMP,'
--------------- --------------- --------------- -------------------
fred         SCOTT              app93           05-16-2009 16:21:13

IMPORTANT NOTE:  Using Oracle auditing for failed sign-on's imposes system overhead and may slow-down other transactions.  For complete directions on auditing Oracle logins, see my book "Oracle Privacy Security Auditing".
