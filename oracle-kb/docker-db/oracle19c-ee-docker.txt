--------------------------------
STARTING CUSTOMIZED CONTAINER
--------------------------------
Custom Configurations
Oracle Database server container also provides configuration parameters that can be used when starting the container. Following is the detailed docker run command supporting all custom configurations:

docker run -d --name <container_name> \
 -p <host_port>:1521 -p <host_port>:5500 \
 -e ORACLE_SID=<your_SID> \
 -e ORACLE_PDB=<your_PDBname> \
 -e ORACLE_PWD=<your_database_password> \
 -e INIT_SGA_SIZE=<your_database_SGA_memory_MB> \
 -e INIT_PGA_SIZE=<your_database_PGA_memory_MB> \
 -e ORACLE_EDITION=<your_database_edition> \
 -e ORACLE_CHARACTERSET=<your_character_set> \
 -e ENABLE_ARCHIVELOG=true \
 -v [<host_mount_point>:]/opt/oracle/oradata \
container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:21.3.0.0

Parameters:
 --name:                 The name of the container (default: auto generated
 -p:                     The port mapping of the host port to the container port.
                         Two ports are exposed: 1521 (Oracle Listener), 5500 (OEM Express)
 -e ORACLE_SID:          The Oracle Database SID that should be used (default:ORCLCDB)
 -e ORACLE_PDB:          The Oracle Database PDB name that should be used (default: ORCLPDB1)
 -e ORACLE_PWD:          The Oracle Database SYS, SYSTEM and PDBADMIN password (default: auto generated)
 -e INIT_SGA_SIZE:       The total memory in MB that should be used for all SGA components (optional)
 -e INIT_PGA_SIZE:       The target aggregate PGA memory in MB that should be used for all server processes attached to the instance (optional)
 -e ORACLE_EDITION:      The Oracle Database Edition (enterprise/standard, default: enterprise)
 -e ORACLE_CHARACTERSET: The character set to use when creating the database (default: AL32UTF8)
 -e ENABLE_ARCHIVELOG:   To enable archive log mode when creating the database (default: false). Supported 19.3 onwards.
 -v /opt/oracle/oradata
                         The data volume to use for the database. Has to be writable by the Unix "oracle" (uid: 54321) user inside the container
                         If omitted the database will not be persisted over container recreation.
 -v /opt/oracle/scripts/startup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/startup
                         Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database startup.
                         For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on
                         startup" section below.
 -v /opt/oracle/scripts/setup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup
                         Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database setup.
                         For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.

The supported configuration options are:

ORACLE_SID

This parameter changes the Oracle system identifier (SID) of the database. This parameter is optional and the default value is set to ORCLCDB.

ORACLE_PDB

This parameter modifies the name of the pluggable database (PDB). This parameter is optional and the default value is set to ORCLPDB1.

ORACLE_PWD

This parameter modifies the password for the SYS, SYSTEM and PDBADMIN users. This parameter is optional and the default value is randomly generated. This password can be changed later as described in the section titled "Changing the Default Password for SYS User".

INIT_SGA_SIZE

This parameter modifies the memory in MB that should be used for all SGA components. This parameter is optional, and the default value is calculated during database creation if it isn¿t provided. The user can refer to the section titled ¿Setting the SGA and PGA memory¿ for more details.

INIT_PGA_SIZE

This parameter modifies the target aggregate memory in MB that should be used for all server processes attached to the instance. This parameter is optional, and the default value is calculated during database creation if it isn¿t provided. The user can refer to the section titled ¿Setting the SGA and PGA memory¿ for more details.

ORACLE_EDITION

This parameter modifies the edition of the database when the container is started for the first time. This parameter is optional and the two values are enterprise or standard. The default value is enterprise.

ORACLE_CHARACTERSET

This parameter modifies the character set of the database. This parameter is optional and the default value is set to AL32UTF8.

ENABLE_ARCHIVELOG

This parameter enables the ARCHIVELOG mode while creating the database for the first time. Default value of this parameter is false.

===============================
Reusing the Existing Database
===============================
Oracle Database server image uses docker data volumes to store data files, redo logs, audit logs, alert logs, and trace files. The data volume is mounted within the container at /opt/oracle/oradata. To start a database with a data volume, use the docker run command as follows:

$ docker run -d --name <oracle-db> -v
OracleDBData:/opt/oracle/oradata
container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:21.3.0.0
OracleDBData is the data volume that is created by docker and mounted within the container in the path /opt/oracle/oradata. During the first instance, data files are created in the new data volume. After the container is destroyed, the data files are kept persistent and can be reused to start another container with the same data files if the same ORACLE_SID parameter is provided. When using data volumes created by docker, the file system used by docker affects the performance of Oracle Database server. The performance on the ext4 file system is better as compared to that on the btrfs file system.

To use a directory on the host system for the data volume, execute the following:

$ docker run -d --name <oracle-db> -v
<writable_directory_path>:/opt/oracle/oradata
container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:21.3.0.0
Note: If you provide standard as the value for the ORACLE_EDITION parameter while creating the data files for the first time, you must provide the same value when reusing those data files to start a new container.

==============================================================
Performing operations that require Database Shutdown/Startup
==============================================================
To perform operations on the database that require the restart of the database, use the maintenance shutdown/startup scripts, /home/oracle/shutDown.sh and /home/oracle/startUp.sh instead of issuing shutdown immediate and startup commands respectively as the latter would lead to exiting of the container.
