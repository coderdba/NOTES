Firewall rules to Oracle DB
==============================
From source machines, these database listener address:port will be destinations:
- SCAN-Address - port 1526 (or other scan listener port) - both primary and standby  - no need to list underlying IP's as the SCAN is a  VIP to underlying IP's and routes using one of the IPs
- Host and/or VIP (in some cases hostname only where VIPs are not used) - port 1521 (or other scan listener port) - both primary and standby nodes 

If we like to include every IP:
