Packer is used to create VM images from OS ISOs or existing images
- and:
- install additional packages
- configure users
- copy files into the image
- install software like Kubernetes
- pre-setup virtual network cards, IP addresses etc
- configure Kubernetes cluster - so that cluster comes up when a VM is spun off...

First - create a qcow2 kind of image using Packer with OS and additional stuff
Then - spin up VM using the image - using virsh & KVM and such
-- NOTE: The VMs can be further customized with cloud-init (with user-data and meta-data) when you spin up the VM
