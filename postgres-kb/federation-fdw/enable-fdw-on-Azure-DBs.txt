ENABLE EXTENSIONS 'ALLOWED LIST'
=================================
when i try to create postgres_fdw extension I get this error: 
ERROR:  extension "postgres_fdw" is not allow-listed for "azure_pg_admin" users in Azure Database for PostgreSQL

The error you're encountering indicates that the postgres_fdw extension is not allow-listed for the azure_pg_admin role in your Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance. To resolve this, you need to allow-list the extension. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Go to the Azure Portal:

Navigate to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance.
Access Server Parameters:

In the left-hand menu, select Server parameters under the Settings section.
Allow-list the Extension:

Find the azure.extensions parameter.
Add postgres_fdw to the list of allowed extensions.
Save the changes.
Create the Extension:

After allow-listing, you should be able to create the extension using:
CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;
If you continue to face issues, ensure that your PostgreSQL instance supports the postgres_fdw extension and that you have the necessary permissions12.

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance!
