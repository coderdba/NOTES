How to Install Go on CentOS 7

Go, often referred to as golang is a modern open-source programming language created by Google. Many popular applications, including Kubernetes, Docker, Hugo, and Caddy are written in Go.

In this tutorial, we will show you how to download and install Go on a CentOS 7 system.
Prerequisites

How to Install Go

At the time of writing this article, the latest stable version of Go is version 1.13. Before downloading the tarball, visit the official Go downloads page and check if there is a new version available.

Follow the steps below to install Go on CentOS 7:

    Download the tarball.

    To download the Go binary use either wget or curl :

    wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Verify the tarball.

Once the download is completed verify the tarball checksum with the sha256sum command:

sha256sum go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz

68a2297eb099d1a76097905a2ce334e3155004ec08cdea85f24527be3c48e856  go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Make sure the hash printed from the command above matches the one from the downloads page.

Extract the tarball.

Use the tar command to extract the tarball to the /usr/local directory:

sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.13.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Adjust the Path Variable.

Now we need to tell our system where to find the Go executable binaries by adjusting the $PATH environment variable.

We can do this by appending the following line to the /etc/profile file (for a system-wide installation) or to the $HOME/.bash_profile file (for a current user installation):
~/.bash_profile

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

Save the file, and load the new PATH environment variable into the current shell session with the following command:

source ~/.bash_profile

Install InfluxDB Go client library

go get github.com/influxdata/influxdb1-client/v2

Add a directory of pg_config to PATH and build and install influxdb_fdw.

export PATH=

make USE_PGXS=1 with_llvm=no
make install USE_PGXS=1 with_llvm=no

with_llvm=no is necessary to disable llvm bit code generation when PostgreSQL is configured with --with-llvm 
because influxdb_fdw use go code and cannot be compiled to llvm bit code.

If you want to build influxdb_fdw in a source tree of PostgreSQL instead, use

make with_llvm=no
make install  with_llvm=no
