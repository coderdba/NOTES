  Table sizes - listing by schema and table name:
  WITH tbl_spc AS (
  SELECT ts.spcname AS spcname
  FROM pg_tablespace ts 
  JOIN pg_database db ON db.dattablespace = ts.oid
  WHERE db.datname = current_database()
  )
  (
  SELECT
  t.schemaname,
  t.tablename,
  pg_table_size('"' || t.schemaname || '"."' || t.tablename || '"') AS table_disc_size,
  NULL as index,
  0 as index_disc_size,
  COALESCE(t.tablespace, ts.spcname) AS tablespace
  FROM pg_tables t, tbl_spc ts

  UNION ALL

  SELECT
  i.schemaname,
  i.tablename,
  0,
  i.indexname,
  pg_relation_size('"' || i.schemaname || '"."' || i.indexname || '"'),
  COALESCE(i.tablespace, ts.spcname)
  FROM pg_indexes i, tbl_spc ts
  )
  ORDER BY table_disc_size DESC,index_disc_size DESC;

  Table+Index size:
  SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('size_test_table'));
  
  Table and index size and total size:
  SELECT pg_table_size('size_test_table') AS data_size,
  pg_relation_size('size_test_table_pkey') AS index_size,
  pg_table_size('size_test_table') + pg_relation_size('size_test_table_pkey') AS total_size1,
  pg_total_relation_size('size_test_table') AS total_size2;
  
  Largest table listing:
  SELECT
  t.tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('"' || t.schemaname || '"."' || t.tablename || '"')) AS table_total_disc_size
  FROM pg_tables t
  WHERE
   t.schemaname = 'public'
  ORDER BY
