In Python, when running inside a Kubernetes pod, the following line retrieves the hostname of the pod (replica) as assigned by Kubernetes. This hostname is typically the name of the pod, unless explicitly overridden.
hostname = socket.gethostname()

What this means in Kubernetes:
Kubernetes assigns a DNS-compliant name to each pod.
By default, this name is used as the pod's hostname.
So socket.gethostname() will return something like:
my-pod-name-abc123
