NPMRC FILE WITH PRIVATE REGISTRIES, REGISTRIES IN GITHUB 
================================

If private registries are hosted in github, then "npm install" may fail:

To fix:
- generate a personal access token in github
- add the following into your $HOME/.npmrc
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=ghp_XOuOecDeYMzALKDSFXdwrNUaZH30S3HZN
@mycompany-global:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com

- then you can do "npm install" from those registries

To do npm install into your react project under "node-modules" folder:
- add .npmrc into .gitignore of the project
- copy your .npmrc to the project folder
- do npm install work
- remove .npmrc from project folder for safety
