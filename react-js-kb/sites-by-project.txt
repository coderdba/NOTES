ISSUE - CORS ISSUE WITH GRAPH
========================================
To avoid cors issue with microsoft graph, in authConfig.js,
use v1.0/me endpoint (which is the original one) --> as in the quickstart - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/single-page-app-quickstart?pivots=devlang-react)
do not use just "https://graph.microsoft.com" --> as suggested in the other tutorial (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/tutorial-v2-react)

export const graphConfig = {
    //graphMeEndpoint: "https://graph.microsoft.com" // this gave CORS error
    graphMeEndpoint: "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me" // this did NOT give CORS error
};

ISSUE -  ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED
=========================================
What worked - downgrading node version to 16.x worked

This did not work - https://roytuts.com/how-to-fix-err_ossl_evp_unsupported-in-react-js-application/
-->  in Package.json --> "start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start",
Try this - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69394632/webpack-build-failing-with-err-ossl-evp-unsupported
--> downgrade node version (see dockerfile)
