1. Overview
SSH, the secure shell, is often used to access remote Linux systems. Because we often use it to connect with computers containing important data, it’s recommended to add another security layer. Here comes the two factor authentication (2FA).

What is two-factor authentication
Multi-factor authentication is a method of confirming your identity using at least two different ways of authentication. The most common and easiest to implement example of two-factor authentication uses a combination of passphrase (a complex password, often made of several words) and one-time-passcode generated by a special mobile app.

We will use the Google Authenticator app available for Android (in the Play Store) and iOS (in iTunes) to generate authentication codes.

What you’ll need
A computer running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or above
A phone running Android or iOS
A configured SSH connection
You should understand the danger of stolen passwords.
You don’t need to know what two-factor authentication is and how it works.
