can grafana agent call a custom script to collect metrics like exec plugin of Telegraf

Copilot
Sent by Copilot:
Yes, Grafana Agent can call a custom script to collect metrics, similar to the exec plugin in Telegraf. You can achieve this by using the prometheus.scrape component in Grafana Agent Flow mode. This component allows you to scrape metrics from a custom endpoint, which can be a script outputting metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format1.

For example, you can write a custom script (e.g., in Python or Bash) that outputs metrics, and then configure Grafana Agent to scrape these metrics by specifying the script’s endpoint in the configuration2.

Sure! Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up Grafana Agent to call a custom script for collecting metrics:

Step 1: Write Your Custom Script
First, create a script that outputs metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format. Here’s a simple example in Python:

Python

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import time

def main():
    while True:
        print("# HELP my_custom_metric A custom metric")
        print("# TYPE my_custom_metric gauge")
        print("my_custom_metric 42")
        time.sleep(10)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Make sure your script is executable:

chmod +x your_script.py

Step 2: Set Up a Web Server to Serve Metrics
You can use a simple HTTP server to serve the metrics. Here’s an example using Python’s built-in HTTP server:

python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory /path/to/your/script/

Step 3: Configure Grafana Agent
Create a configuration file for Grafana Agent. Here’s an example configuration:

server:
  log_level: info

metrics:
  wal_directory: /tmp/grafana-agent-wal
  global:
    scrape_interval: 15s

  configs:
    - name: custom-script
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'custom-script'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8000']

Step 4: Run Grafana Agent
Run Grafana Agent with the configuration file you created:

grafana-agent --config.file=path/to/your/config.yaml

Step 5: Verify Metrics Collection
Navigate to your Grafana instance and check if the metrics from your custom script are being collected.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the Grafana Agent documentation1.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further assistance!

Can different scrape_intervals be set up for different prometheus.scrape component?
Copilot
Sent by Copilot:
Yes, you can set different scrape_interval values for different prometheus.scrape components in Grafana Agent. Each prometheus.scrape component can have its own configuration, including a unique scrape_interval.

Here’s an example configuration with two prometheus.scrape components, each with a different scrape_interval:

server:
  log_level: info

metrics:
  wal_directory: /tmp/grafana-agent-wal
  global:
    scrape_interval: 15s

  configs:
    - name: custom-scrapes
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'custom-script-1'
          scrape_interval: 30s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8000']

        - job_name: 'custom-script-2'
          scrape_interval: 60s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8001']

In this example:

The first scrape job (custom-script-1) has a scrape_interval of 30 seconds.
The second scrape job (custom-script-2) has a scrape_interval of 60 seconds.
This allows you to tailor the scraping frequency based on the specific needs of each target12.

Can you give a shell script example instead of python example above?
Copilot
Sent by Copilot:
Sure! Here’s an example of a shell script that outputs metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format:

Shell Script Example
#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  echo "# HELP my_custom_metric A custom metric"
  echo "# TYPE my_custom_metric gauge"
  echo "my_custom_metric $(date +%s)"
  sleep 10
done

Steps to Set Up
Save the Script: Save the above script to a file, for example, custom_metrics.sh.
Make the Script Executable:
chmod +x custom_metrics.sh

Set Up a Web Server to Serve Metrics: You can use netcat to serve the script output over HTTP. Here’s an example command:
while true; do { echo -e 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n'; ./custom_metrics.sh; } | nc -l -p 8000; done

Configure Grafana Agent: Create a configuration file for Grafana Agent. Here’s an example configuration:
server:
  log_level: info

metrics:
  wal_directory: /tmp/grafana-agent-wal
  global:
    scrape_interval: 15s

  configs:
    - name: custom-script
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'custom-script'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8000']

Run Grafana Agent: Run Grafana Agent with the configuration file you created:
grafana-agent --config.file=path/to/your/config.yaml

Verify Metrics Collection: Navigate to your Grafana instance and check if the metrics from your custom script are being collected.
This setup will allow Grafana Agent to scrape metrics from your shell script. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

Is it possible to set up a target without target being a http server?
Copilot
Sent by Copilot:
Yes, it is possible to set up a target without it being an HTTP server in Grafana Agent. You can use various methods to collect metrics from non-HTTP sources. Here are a few approaches:

1. Node Exporter Textfile Collector
You can use the Node Exporter Textfile Collector to read metrics from files. This method allows you to write metrics to a file in the Prometheus text format, and the Node Exporter will read and expose these metrics.

Create a Metrics File:
echo "# HELP my_custom_metric A custom metric" > /path/to/metrics.prom
echo "# TYPE my_custom_metric gauge" >> /path/to/metrics.prom
echo "my_custom_metric 42" >> /path/to/metrics.prom

Configure Node Exporter: Ensure Node Exporter is configured to read from the directory containing your metrics file:
collectors_enabled: [ "textfile" ]
textfile.directory: /path/to/

Configure Grafana Agent:
metrics:
  wal_directory: /tmp/grafana-agent-wal
  global:
    scrape_interval: 15s

  configs:
    - name: node-exporter
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'node-exporter'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:9100']

2. Pushgateway
You can use Prometheus Pushgateway to push metrics from your script to a central location where Grafana Agent can scrape them.

Push Metrics to Pushgateway:
echo "my_custom_metric 42" | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/custom_job

Configure Grafana Agent:
metrics:
  wal_directory: /tmp/grafana-agent-wal
  global:
    scrape_interval: 15s

  configs:
    - name: pushgateway
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'pushgateway'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:9091']

3. Custom Exporter
You can write a custom exporter that collects metrics from various sources and exposes them in a Prometheus-compatible format.

Write a Custom Exporter: You can use libraries like prometheus_client in Python or prometheus-client in Go to create an exporter.
Run the Exporter: Ensure your exporter runs and exposes metrics on a specific port.
Configure Grafana Agent:
metrics:
  wal_directory: /tmp/grafana-agent-wal
  global:
    scrape_interval: 15s

  configs:
    - name: custom-exporter
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'custom-exporter'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:your_exporter_port']
