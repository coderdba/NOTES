Maybe we should set GO111MODULE=on 
--> with that not set at all, atom was pulling golang packages into gopath/src instead of gopath/pkg
--> also, not sure if it will then support coding outside of gopath as well

Install package go-plus
Install package platformio-ide-terminal to get terminal

Control ` --> for getting PS terminal in atom


Additional tools (from file --> settings --> packages --> go-plus --> settings)
--> Note: these installs were prompted when first installed without setting GO111MODULE
-->       later, when reinstalled go-plus with GO111MODULE=on, installs of these were not prompted
