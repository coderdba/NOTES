--------------------
GET TERMINAL IN ATOM
--------------------
Control ` --> for getting PS terminal in atom

Maybe we should set GO111MODULE=on 
--> with that not set at all, atom was pulling golang packages into gopath/src instead of gopath/pkg
--> also, not sure if it will then support coding outside of gopath as well

--------------------
INSTALL PACKAGAES
--------------------
go-plus --> the main one
go-debug
platformio-ide-terminal

Tried installing these additional ones:
go-guru (said it needs go-get, go-config - but, could not find go-get or go-config packages in +install search)
go-signature-statusbar - installed ok

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL TOOLS - MAY BE PROMPTED AS AND WHEN NEEDED (see note further below)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional tools list (from file --> settings --> packages --> go-plus --> settings)
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/gorename
go get -u github.com/sqs/goreturns
go get -u github.com/mdempsky/gocode
go get -u github.com/alecthomas/gometalinter
go get -u github.com/mgechev/revive
go get -u github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint
go get -u github.com/zmb3/gogetdoc
go get -u github.com/zmb3/goaddimport
go get -u github.com/rogpeppe/godef
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru
go get -u github.com/fatih/gomodifytags
go get -u github.com/tpng/gopkgs
go get -u github.com/ramya-rao-a/go-outline

--> Note: these installs were prompted when first installed without setting GO111MODULE
-->       later, when reinstalled go-plus with GO111MODULE=on, installs of these were not prompted
--> HOWEVER, PROMPTED when created a project directory, a main.go file in that directory and clicked on main.go file
--> Got this prompt:
Go Get
The go-debug package uses the dlv tool, but it cannot be found.
Would you like to run go get -u github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv?

--> Then, many go-get's were executed --> still, putting them all into gopath/src folder (not gopath/pkg folder) --> and, exes in gopath/bin folder
--> VIEW THESE go-get's in the atom panel at the bottom with 'output' checked
