Eclipse-Springboot project:  https://medium.com/danielpadua/java-spring-boot-eclipse-744454468670

ECLIPSE
Version 2022-09
Installed for "java and web developers"
It installed JVM 17
C:\Users\MYUSERID\eclipse\jee-2022-09

ECLIPSE - SPRING TOOLS
Help --> Eclipse Marketplace
Search for "spring"
Install the latest version of Spring Tools (on the writing date of this guide it is the 4.16.0) and restart eclipse.
- in the list in that, did not choose cloud foundry and concourse 

CREATE A PROJECT - spring starter project
With everything correctly configured, it’s time to create our project. 
Go to menu: File > New > Project… and select the option Spring starter Project 

--> This created a Maven project - I need a Gradle project

ECLIPSE - CREATE A GRADLE PROJECT
File --> New --> Project --> Gradle Project

This created a project with src folder under a lib folder
We need src to be in the base folder itself

In Gradle menu: Window --> Preferences --> Gradle --> it was 8.0-milestone-2
Changed it to 6.9.2 and tried to create a new project

To fix it: https://qaautomation.expert/2021/05/02/how-to-create-java-gradle-project-in-eclipse/
--> use gradle 6.6 --> that did not even create a project - as it could not download gradle 6.6 zip
