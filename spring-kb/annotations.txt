@Component
@Component is the most generic Spring annotation. 
A Java class decorated with @Component is found during classpath scanning and registered in the context as a Spring bean. 
--> This is important - gets detected and registered in the context

@Service, @Repository, and @Controller are specializations of @Component, which are used for more specific cases.

@ComponentScan ensures that the classes decorated with @Component are found and registered as Spring beans. 
@ComponentScan is automatically included with @SpringBootApplication.
--> Springboot application automatically scans for components

@Bean servers a similar purpose as @Component. 
But, It is not autodetected. 
Methods decorated with @Bean produce a bean to be managed by the Spring container during configuration stage.

Application is the entry point which sets up Spring Boot application. 
The @SpringBootApplication annotation enables auto-configuration and component scanning. 
It is a convenience annotation for @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan annotations.
