QUERYING WITH JSON AS OUTPUT
====================================================
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/json/format-query-results-as-json-with-for-json-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16

The results are formatted as an array of JSON objects.

The number of elements in the JSON array is equal to the number of rows in the results of the SELECT statement (before the FOR JSON clause is applied).

Each row in the results of the SELECT statement (before the FOR JSON clause is applied) becomes a separate JSON object in the array.

Each column in the results of the SELECT statement (before the FOR JSON clause is applied) becomes a property of the JSON object.

Both the names of columns and their values are escaped according to JSON syntax. 
For more info, see How FOR JSON escapes special characters and control characters (SQL Server).

DIRECTIVES TO ADD TO SQLs
==================================
FOR JSON
FOR JSON AUTO [INCLUDE_NULL_VALUES]
FOR JSON PATH [ROOT 'root element arbitrary name']

==================================
Control other JSON output options
==================================
Control the output of the FOR JSON clause by using the following additional options.

ROOT. To add a single, top-level element to the JSON output, specify the ROOT option. If you don't specify this option, the JSON output doesn't have a root element. For more info, see Add a Root Node to JSON Output with the ROOT Option (SQL Server).

INCLUDE_NULL_VALUES. To include null values in the JSON output, specify the INCLUDE_NULL_VALUES option. If you don't specify this option, the output doesn't include JSON properties for NULL values in the query results. For more info, see Include Null Values in JSON Output with the INCLUDE_NULL_VALUES Option (SQL Server).

WITHOUT_ARRAY_WRAPPER. To remove the square brackets that surround the JSON output of the FOR JSON clause by default, specify the WITHOUT_ARRAY_WRAPPER option. Use this option to generate a single JSON object as output from a single-row result. If you don't specify this option, the JSON output is formatted as an array - that is, it's enclosed within square brackets. For more info, see Remove Square Brackets from JSON Output with the WITHOUT_ARRAY_WRAPPER Option (SQL Server).
