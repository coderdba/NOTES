DESIGN
========================================
NoSQL database
Containers - table, Item - row
Partitions - a container can be partitioned on a partition key

Multi-region
- container level
- whole data in container gets replicated across regions
- single master / multi master
-- single master - single "write region" - one region only for write, all others are read-only
-- multi master - multiple write-regions - conflicting writes can be resolved by either the default Last Write Wins policy, or a custom JavaScript function.

Change feed
- clients can subscribe to in order to get notified of new items being added or updated in the container
- item deletions are currently not exposed by the change feed
- changes are persisted by Cosmos DB, which makes it possible to request changes from any point in time since the creation of the container.

Time to Live 
- for item to be deleted after last update

Stored Procedure - executed on a partition - so, must supply partition key when invoking
Triggers
User Defined Functions (UDFs)

PERFORMANCE
========================================
TUNABLE THROUGHPUT
- Throughput at Performance (10ms)
- RU - Request Unit - The cost to read a 1 KB item is 1 Request Unit (or 1 RU)
- Cost per RU - about 0.008 per hour - The minimum billing is per hour
- Cost is for one region - for additional regions multiply the cost by number of regions
- Cost example: 1,000,000 records of 1k each in 5s requires 1,000,000 RUs At $0.008/hour, which would equal $800. 
-- Two regions double the cost

RU CONSIDERATIONS
- Select by 'id' operations consume lower number of RUs compared to Delete, Update, and Insert operations for the same document. 
- Large queries (e.g. aggregations like count) and stored procedure executions can consume hundreds to thousands of RUs depending on the complexity of the operations needed.

COSMOS DB PROFILER
The Cosmos DB Profiler cloud cost optimization tool detects inefficient data queries in the interactions between an application and its Cosmos DB database. 
The profiler alerts users to wasted performance and excessive cloud expenditures. 
It also recommends how to resolve them by isolating and analyzing the code and directing its users to the exact location.
