Shard rebalance on node loss/add: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/open-distro-elasticsearch-shard-allocation/

Index (instead of table)
--> shards (hash partition of the index)
  --> replicas (multiple copies of the shards)

shard replicas (or single copies if no replicas) are distributed across nodes
upon node loss, lost replicas are recreated with data from surviving nodes
you can delay the reallocation to prevent unnecessary rebalance twice when a node goes down and comes back or replaced
