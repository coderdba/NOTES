====================
HEAP
====================
The heap is divided into three sections:

Young Generation: Newly created objects start in the Young Generation. The Young Generation is further subdivided into an Eden space, where all new objects start, 
and two Survivor spaces, where objects are moved from Eden after surviving one garbage collection cycle. When objects are garbage collected from the Young Generation, 
it is a minor garbage collection event.
Old Generation: Objects that are long-lived are eventually moved from the Young Generation to the Old Generation. When objects are garbage collected from the Old Generation,
it is a major garbage collection event.
Permanent Generation: Metadata such as classes and methods are stored in the Permanent Generation. Classes that are no longer 
in use may be garbage collected from the Permanent Generation.

=========================
GARBAGE COLLECTOR TYPES
=========================
Set using JVM parameters.

Oracle JVM HotSpot has four garbage collectors:

Serial: All garbage collection events are conducted serially in one thread. Compaction is executed after each garbage collection.

Parallel: Multiple threads are used for minor garbage collection. A single thread is used for major garbage collection and Old Generation compaction. 
Alternatively, the Parallel Old variant uses multiple threads for major garbage collection and Old Generation compaction.

CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep): Multiple threads are used for minor garbage collection using the same algorithm as Parallel. Major garbage collection is multi-threaded, 
like Parallel Old, but CMS runs concurrently alongside application processes to minimize “stop the world” events (i.e. when the garbage collector running stops the application).
No compaction is performed.

G1 (Garbage First): The newest garbage collector is intended as a replacement for CMS. It is parallel and concurrent like CMS,
but it works quite differently under the hood compared to the older garbage collectors.

NOTES:
Parallel - can cause 'stop the world' events

We may clean up in the code itself by releasing objects/variables
- however, JVMs take care of GCs - but cannot know when they do
