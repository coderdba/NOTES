A Workflow: Workflows are functions that define the overall flow of the application and represent the orchestration aspect of the business logic.

An Activity: Activities are functions called during Workflow Execution and represent the execution aspect of your business logic. The Workflow you'll create executes a single Activity, which takes a string from the Workflow as input and returns a formatted version of this string to the Workflow.

A Worker: Workers host the Activity and Workflow code and execute the code piece by piece.

An initiator: To start a Workflow, you need to send a message to the Temporal server to tell it to track the state of the Workflow. You'll write a separate program to do this.
