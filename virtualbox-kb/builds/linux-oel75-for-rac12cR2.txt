DETAIL1

6.1.8.2 Standard Oracle Database Groups for Job Role Separation
The following is a list of standard Oracle Database groups. These groups provide operating system authentication for database administration system privileges:

OSDBA group (typically, dba)

You must create this group the first time you install Oracle Database software on the system. This group identifies operating system user accounts that have database administrative privileges (the SYSDBA privilege). If you do not create separate OSDBA, OSOPER and OSASM groups for the Oracle ASM instance, then operating system user accounts that have the SYSOPER and SYSASM privileges must be members of this group. The name used for this group in Oracle code examples is dba. If you do not designate a separate group as the OSASM group, then the OSDBA group you define is also by default the OSASM group.

To specify a group name other than the default dba group, you must either choose the Advanced installation type to install the software, or you start Oracle Universal Installer (OUI) as a user that is not a member of this group. If you start OUI with a user that is not a member of a group called dba, then OUI prompts you to specify the name of the OSDBA group.

Members of the OSDBA group formerly were granted SYSASM privilege on Oracle ASM instances, including mounting and dismounting disk groups. This privileges grant is removed with Oracle Grid Infrastructure 11g Release 2 (11.2), if different operating system groups are designated as the OSDBA and OSASM groups. If the same group is used for both OSDBA and OSASM, then the privileges are retained.

OSOPER group for Oracle Database (typically, oper)

You can choose to create this group if you want a separate group of operating system users to have a limited set of database administrative privileges for starting up and shutting down the database (the SYSOPER privilege).

6.1.8.3 Extended Oracle Database Groups for Job Role Separation
Starting with Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1), in addition to the OSOPER privileges to start up and shut down the database, you can create new administrative privileges that are more task-specific and less privileged than the OSDBA/SYSDBA system privileges to support specific administrative privileges tasks required for everyday database operation Users granted these system privileges are also authenticated through operating system group membership.

You do not have to create these specific group names, but during installation you are prompted to provide operating system groups whose members are granted access to these system privileges. You can assign the same group to provide authentication for these privileges, but Oracle recommends that you provide a unique group to designate each privilege.

The OSDBA subset job role separation privileges and groups consist of the following:

OSBACKUPDBA group for Oracle Database (typically, backupdba)

Create this group if you want a separate group of operating system users to have a limited set of database backup and recovery related administrative privileges (the SYSBACKUP privilege).

OSDGDBA group for Oracle Data Guard (typically, dgdba)

Create this group if you want a separate group of operating system users to have a limited set of privileges to administer and monitor Oracle Data Guard (the SYSDG privilege).

OSKMDBA group for encryption key management (typically, kmdba)

Create this group if you want a separate group of operating sytem users to have a limited set of privileges for encryption key management such as Oracle Wallet Manager management (the SYSKM privilege).

6.1.8.4 Oracle ASM Groups for Job Role Separation
The SYSASM, SYSOPER for ASM, and SYSDBA for ASM system privileges enables the separation of the Oracle ASM storage administration privileges from SYSDBA. Members of operating systems you designate are granted the system privileges for these roles. Select separate operating system groups as the operating system authentication groups for privileges on Oracle ASM.

Before you start OUI, create the following OS groups and users for Oracle ASM, whose members are granted the corresponding SYS privileges:

OSASM Group for Oracle ASM Administration (typically asmadmin)

Create this group as a separate group if you want to have separate administration privileges groups for Oracle ASM and Oracle Database administrators. Members of this group are granted the SYSASM system privileges to administer Oracle ASM. In Oracle documentation, the operating system group whose members are granted privileges is called the OSASM group, and in code examples, where there is a group specifically created to grant this privilege, it is referred to as asmadmin.

Oracle ASM can support multiple databases. If you have multiple databases on your system, and use multiple OSDBA groups so that you can provide separate SYSDBA privileges for each database, then you should create a group whose members are granted the OSASM/SYSASM administrative privileges, and create a grid infrastructure user (grid) that does not own a database installation, so that you separate Oracle Grid Infrastructure SYSASM administrative privileges from a database administrative privileges group.

Members of the OSASM group can use SQL to connect to an Oracle ASM instance as SYSASM using operating system authentication. The SYSASM privileges permit mounting and dismounting disk groups, and other storage administration tasks. SYSASM privileges provide no access privileges on an RDBMS instance.

OSDBA for ASM Database Administrator group for ASM, typically asmdba)

Members of the ASM Database Administrator group (OSDBA for ASM) are granted read and write access to files managed by Oracle ASM. The Oracle Grid Infrastructure installation owner and all Oracle Database software owners must be a member of this group, and all users with OSDBA membership on databases that have access to the files managed by Oracle ASM must be members of the OSDBA group for ASM.

OSOPER for ASM Group for ASM Operators (OSOPER for ASM, typically asmoper)

This is an optional group. Create this group if you want a separate group of operating system users to have a limited set of Oracle ASM instance administrative privileges (the SYSOPER for ASM privilege), including starting up and stopping the Oracle ASM instance. By default, members of the OSASM group also have all privileges granted by the SYSOPER for ASM privilege.

To use the Oracle ASM Operator group to create an Oracle ASM administrator group with fewer privileges than the default asmadmin group, then you must choose the Advanced installation type to install the software, In this case, OUI prompts you to specify the name of this group. In code examples, this group is asmoper.


DETAIL2

The secondary groups must include the OSASM group, whose members are granted the SYSASM privilege to administer the 
Oracle ASM instance. You can designate a unique group for the SYSASM system privilege, separate from 
database administrator groups, or you can designate one group as the OSASM and OSDBA group, so that members of 
that group are granted the SYSASM and SYSDBA privilege to grant system privileges to administer both the 
Oracle ASM instances and Oracle Database instances. In code examples, this group is asmadmin.

If you are creating this user to own both Oracle Grid Infrastructure and an Oracle Database installation, then this user 
must have the OSDBA for ASM group as a secondary group. In code examples, this group name is asmdba. Members of the OSDBA 
for ASM group are granted access to Oracle ASM storage. You must create an OSDBA for ASM group if you plan to have multiple
databases accessing Oracle ASM storage, or you must use the same group as the OSDBA for all databases, and for the OSDBA for 
ASM group. You are also prompted during installation to assign operating system groups for several other Oracle Database 
system administrative privileges.

Use the usermod command to change existing user ID numbers and groups.

For example:

# id oracle
uid=1101(oracle) gid=1000(oinstall) groups=1200(dba)
# /usr/sbin/usermod -u 54421 -g 54331 -G 54321,54322,54327 oracle
# id oracle
uid=54321(oracle) gid=54321(oinstall) groups=54321(oinstall),54322(dba),54327 (asmdba)

====================
NEXT STEPS
====================

Create OS users (oracle (already created), grid etc)
Install guest additions
Enable host-guest bidirectional copy-paste and drag-and-drop
Stop NTP
Stop firewall (for RAC install firewall may have to be stopped)
Disable SELinux
Increase screen resolution - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/25236/increasing-screen-size-resolution-on-a-virtualbox-instance-of-centos

Install sshpass
PAM modules
Vagrant
Chef

OPTIONAL: Check if open-jdk is good enough (and version) and install Oracle's JDK if that is better

Install oracle preinstall rpm / validation rpm
Install other required rpms (not all are installed with preinstall rpm)
Install oracleasm modules

------------------------
CREATE USERS
------------------------
Already created:  user 'oracle'
[root@oel75rac12cr2model ~]# id oracle
uid=54321(oracle) gid=54321(oinstall) groups=54321(oinstall),54322(dba),54323(oper),54324(backupdba),54325(dgdba),54326(kmdba),54330(racdba)

Create the 'grid' user:
# groupadd -g 54333 asmdba
# groupadd -g 54334 asmadmin

# useradd -u 54323 -g oinstall -G asmdba,asmadmin grid

Modify Oracle user: (to have additional group 'asmdba')
TBD

[root@oel75rac12cr2model ~]# id grid
uid=54323(grid) gid=54321(oinstall) groups=54321(oinstall),54333(asmdba),54334(asmadmin)


------------------------
INSTALL GUEST ADDITIONS
------------------------
NOTE: Run it logging in as 'root' - better not do a sudo to root - instead, directly logon to root.
ALSO: Set KERN_DIR variable (otherwise 'modprobe vboxsf failed' message may come)
NOTE: This may need kernel uek-devel 
--> which seemed to be installed automatically or otherwise while installing OS or Guest Additions

- Add KERN_DIR environment variable (this may not be necessary)

## Current running kernel on Fedora 28/27/26/25/24/23/22, CentOS 7/6 and Red Hat (RHEL) 7/6 ##
KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/`uname -r`/build

## Current running kernel on CentOS 5 and Red Hat (RHEL) 5 ##
KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/`uname -r`-`uname -m`/build

## Fedora example ##
KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/4.15.6-300.fc27.x86_64/build

## CentOS and Red Hat (RHEL) example ##
KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/4.1.12-112.16.4.el7uek.x86_64/build

## Export KERN_DIR ##
export KERN_DIR


- STEPS
Logon as root
export KERN_DIR=KERN_DIR=/usr/src/kernels/4.1.12-112.16.4.el7uek.x86_64/build
--> This may not be necessary

Click Devices --> Insert Guest Additions CD Image

Asked if the CD can be autorun - clicked that and it ran it.
Alternatively - cd /run/media/root/VBox_GAs_5.2.16 and then run autorun.sh - which will again ask...

In Virtualbox 5.2 version - It ran fine, when KERN_DIR was set. Otherwise, it gave 'vboxsf' modprobe error.

It ran fine, except for the message (in vbox 5.1 version)
Warning: unknown version of the X Window System installed.  Not installing
X Window System drivers.


SOMETHING TO NOTE OR CHECK:
When checked after installing guest-additions:
# rpm -qa|grep uek
kernel-uek-devel-4.1.12-112.16.4.el7uek.x86_64
kernel-uek-firmware-4.1.12-112.16.4.el7uek.noarch

Enable host-guest bidirectional copy-paste and drag-and-drop
----------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.howtogeek.com/187535/how-to-copy-and-paste-between-a-virtualbox-host-machine-and-a-guest-machine/
In Virtualbox menu, 
choose the machine -> settings -> Advanced -> 
- Shared Clipboard -> Bidirectional
- Drag'n'Drop -> Bidirectional

-------------
Stop NTP
-------------
NTP did not seem to be installed
First install ntp - in the case we want to use it sometime (https://www.tecmint.com/install-ntp-server-in-centos/)

# yum install ntp
# service ntpd status
(this shows as inactive - leave as is)

here
-------------
STOP FIREWALL
-------------
[root@localhost network-scripts]# service firewalld stop
Redirecting to /bin/systemctl stop firewalld.service

[root@localhost network-scripts]# chkconfig firewalld off
Note: Forwarding request to 'systemctl disable firewalld.service'.
Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/firewalld.service.
Removed symlink /etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.fedoraproject.FirewallD1.service.

-----------------
DISABLE SELINUX
-----------------

Edit the file /etc/sysconfig/selinux (which is symlink to /etc/selinux/config) 
and set SELINUX=permissive (or disabled) instead of 'enforcing'

# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=permissive
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of three two values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     minimum - Modification of targeted policy. Only selected processes are protected.
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted


---------------------------
INCREASE SCREEN RESOLUTION
---------------------------
If guest-additions have been installed properly, then changing screen size should automtically adjust resolution.
In addition, on the VM right bottom corner dock, there is a display-icon --> virtual-screen-1 --> <various resolutions>
--> If guest-additions have not been installed properly then the resolution-list would be greyed out
--> if it is greyed out, then re-run guest-additions as 'root' user

----------------------------
INSTALL SSHPASS
----------------------------
This is a utility that allows providing password to ssh commands.

- Download 
# wget ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/dag/redhat/el7/en/x86_64/dag/RPMS/sshpass-1.05-1.el7.rf.x86_64.rpm

INSTALL CHEF
================
# mkdir /root/Downloads/chef_installer
# cd /root/Downloads/chef_installer
# curl -LO https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh
# chmod +x install.sh

NOTE - Running install.sh without version installs the latest - which is not always desirable
Instead, provide a version also "./install.sh -v 13.2.20"

Anyway, ran without version and it installed version 14.1.1
# ./install.sh

# which chef-client
/usr/bin/chef-client

# chef-client -v
Chef: 14.1.1

VAGRANT - MAKE IT A VAGRANT BOX
================================
http://www.oaktable.net/content/preparing-oracle-linux-vagrant-box

Create vagrant user:
# useradd vagrant

Set its password to vagrant:
# passwd vagrant (and then give vagrant as password)

Download its insecure authorized keys from Vagrant git:
# sudo su - vagrant
As vagrant user:
$ mkdir ~/.ssh
$ curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mitchellh/vagrant/master/keys/vagrant.pub > .ssh/authorized_keys
(you can use wget also)
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

---------------------------------
Add vagrant to sudoers file
---------------------------------
Edit /etc/sudoers:

Comment out 'Defaults requiretty' --> so that vagrant ssh and sudo does not require a terminal
#Defaults    requiretty

Add vagrant to sudoers
vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
