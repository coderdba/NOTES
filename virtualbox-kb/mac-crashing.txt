After clicking on "Report...", it was always clear the VirtualBox caused the crash as I could see the message BSD process name corresponding to current thread: VirtualBoxVM.

To solve, first I've tried to downgrade/upgrade my VirtualBox to another release or the latest version but the problem persisted. So, I've realized that this problem was somehow related to the parameters of my VM. So I started playing with them making all possible combinations of:

Reducing my VM to less or a single CPU.
Changing my VM Chipset.
Disabling PAE/NX.
Disabling Nested Paging.
Changing Paravirtualization Interface.
So the only one that really solved my problem and stopped those randoms Kernel Panic was the last one, changing Paravirtualization Interface to None.



Finally the crashes were resolved. By the way, I didn't notice any performance reduction after changing that, so this is how my VMs are defined from now on my Mac.
