HOST-ONLY NETWORK

With this, host can ping/connect to guest and vice-versa.

ADD A CUSTOM HOST-NETWORK WITH DESIRED IP RANGE

Suppose you want to have your VMs with IP address range 192.168.8.XXX
- Go to File-->Host Network Adapter
- Add a new adapter like 'vboxnet1'
- Modify its properties to match 192.168.8.XXX
-- Configure adapter manually --> IPV4 Address = 192.168.8.1 - which will act as the gateway
-- Similarly configure DHCP (if required) --> to match the IP range
- Verify on host
vboxnet0 is the default one that is set by virtualbox
vboxnet1 is the one we created

$ ifconfig -a
vboxnet0: flags=8943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
	ether 0a:00:27:00:00:00 
	inet 192.168.99.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.99.255
vboxnet1: flags=8943<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
	ether 0a:00:27:00:00:01 
	inet 192.168.8.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.8.255

- add host-only adapter 'vboxnet1' to the vm
- set the ip address matching the adapter settins - like 192.168.8.11
- ping that IP from host
- ping 192.168.8.1 (host adapter ip) from guest

- ssh from host to guest:
  $ ssh root@192.168.8.11
