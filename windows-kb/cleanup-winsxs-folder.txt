SCHEDULE BASED FIX
====================================
Run the StartComponentCleanup task in Task Scheduler to clean up and compress components
If Task Scheduler is not open, start the Task Scheduler. For more information, see Start Task Scheduler.

Expand the console tree and navigate to Task Scheduler Library\Microsoft\Windows\Servicing\StartComponentCleanup.

Under Selected Item, click Run

schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Servicing\StartComponentCleanup"

====================================
MANUAL FIX RUN
====================================
Dism.exe
The /Cleanup-Image parameter of Dism.exe provides advanced users more options to further reduce the size of the WinSxS folder. For more information, see DISM Operating System Package Servicing Command-Line Options.

Use the /StartComponentCleanup parameter
Using the /StartComponentCleanup parameter of Dism.exe on a running version of Windows 10 or later gives you similar results to running the StartComponentCleanup task in Task Scheduler, except previous versions of updated components will be immediately deleted (without a 30 day grace period) and you will not have a 1-hour timeout limitation.

From an elevated command prompt, run:

Windows Command Prompt


Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
Use the /ResetBase switch with the /StartComponentCleanup parameter
Using the /ResetBase parameter together with the /StartComponentCleanup parameter of DISM.exe on a running version of Windows 10 or later removes all superseded versions of every component in the component store.

From an elevated command prompt, run:

Windows Command Prompt

Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
